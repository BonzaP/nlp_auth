0,i recently stayed at the britannia international hotel and i must say that it was a pleasant experience while it is true that the furniture is slightly older it carries a charming vintage feel that adds character to the space the pieces are made of solid wood and although they show signs of use they fit perfectly into the traditional english ambiance of the hotelthe staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming throughout our stay which made a big difference the room conditions were excellent there was ample heating plenty of hot water and the bathroom was spotless the cleanliness overall was exemplary and it was clear that attention to detail is a priority herefor the price the hotel offers great value in terms of quality comfort and service yes it is a bit farther from the main tourist attractions but with proper planning and londons efficient transport system getting around was not an issue at alllastly a special thanks to the hotel staff for their excellent hospitality i would highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for an affordable yet comfortable place to stay in london,4/5
1,ill be honest i have stayed in several britannia hotels before and have come to expect a budget experience the properties are usually run down and staff a bit unmotivated and indeed that was my experience a few years ago when i visited the britannia international but this visit was completely different my room was in the basement and appeared to have been recently refurbished it was spotlessly clean and comfortable the staff on the front desk were very charming and accommodating allowing me to check in a little early so i could drop my luggage off the public areas were as before to be fair very well presented there is a nice bar area overlooking the dock plenty of space with comfy chairs in the lobby when you consider that in the same price range there are travelodges and premier inns i wouldnt hesitate to recommend staying at the international over them,4/5
2,the hotel is very nice with the christmas decorations the room is quite large with privileged views of canary wharf the service is quite basic cleaning every  days seems insufficient to me in fact the window panes were quite dirty but i must also say that the location is magnificent well connected by underground buses or boat which can be a great experience to go along the river to central london having a wine enjoying the views and the boat ride for a modest price of course i recommend it ,4/5
3,the only positive thing i can comment on is the location the hotel in itself is not great to say the least the lobby and common areas have a smell so dense and chemical its like walking into a christmas scented candle the rooms have no proper ventilation as well as bedsstayed in a room with two single beds that feel like the mattress is about to slide off and walls that were thinner than paper the shampoo and body soaps were a total joke considering the hotel has four stars we had breakfast included and were utterly disappointed to find sunny side up eggs that had the texture of plastic bacon that could not be chewed through and instant coffee packets since the coffee machine was broken even though there was a perfectly functional machine in the bar there were no vegetables in sight and the one basket of fruit left the fruit with a sticky residue when picked up to top off a very mediocre breakfast the staff was very unwelcoming and seemed to be conflicted about hotel policies like wether or not to bring down your stapled paper with your room number on it to breakfast or not needless to say the hotel i experienced was not one of four stars,2/5
4,my stomach dropped to the floor as soon as i entered all furniture completely damaged and food and drip stains rips  tears on all curtains carpets dirty marks all over walls and torn wallpaper smells like a homeless hostel the bed had bed bugs got bitten and the mattress sunken stained and smelly the evening meal left most people speechless a bag of frozen veg from iceland halal only food strange food choices not edible i have no words the restaurant is disgusting dirty cheap stained carpet tiles no decor rough coat of paint only water given to drink nothing more than a run down empty room and the staff cater for certain groups only i feel upset wasted my moneyleaving this place feeling dirty need to go home for a bath a horrible place and  star only anyone who gives this hotel a good review has no standards at all and they are probably street sleepers themselves,1/5
5,great location for a low cost hotel used it a couple of times to stay over after a gig at the o never disappointedjust set expectations appropriately my room has no window but who cares im only sleeping there clean quiet nice  warm pleasant bathroom its a bit of a rabbit warren in the lower ground and finding your room needs a hobbitlike flair for exploring underground but you only do it a couple of times bar is nice think  viberecommended but dont go thinking you het the ritz,3/5
6,never left a review before but felt this place deserved one i did not have a pleasant experience how this place can claim it is  is beyond me stayed for  nights and was kept awake for  of those nights by the fire alarm repeatedly going off from  am cleaning staff making large amounts of noise in the corridors very early with no regard for the guests reception staff were utterly miserable no eye contact or any general manners bar staff were nice though rooms are very dated and poorly decoratedwhen checking out there were no staff around at  am to whom i could talk to you just throw the key cards in a box and bugger offoverall not a nice stay in hindsight it is worth paying more and staying somewhere where you can actually sleeponly positive is the location very easy walk to canada place and tube stations,1/5
7,this hotel is smoke and mirrors while the lobby is beautiful that is where the glamour ends our soap dish in the shower was thick with gross scum our bed was two single beds pushed together neither our phone nor fan worked wallpaper is coming off the walls in the hallway and other than the lobby where they seem to put their money the place is shabby though they ask a lot of money to stay there if you are handicapped they lock you out at night and dont pay attention when you come to the doors we asked stephen for an extra pillow that never arrived if you are out and about london late at night eat before you get back as their food service will be closed and they do not allow outside food to come into the hotel dont bother expressing concerns to the general manager as he could not be less bothered to listen though we stayed here once before we shall not be staying here again had the general manager been more engaged maybe but we were simply blown off by this pompous man without your customers mate what do you have get off your high horse and listen to them,2/5
8,extremely friendly and pleasant helpful staff throughout check out time would be better if it was later than ambeautifully decorated for xmas lovely lobby and bar arearooms big  spacious beds not very comfortable but didnt interrupt sleep,4/5
9,this is more of a budget hotel but if you can look past the outdated d√©cor and horrible lift then it represents fairly good valuerooms are quite spacious and generally clean and comfortablewhat really sets this hotel apart from others is the locationthe hotel is situated approximately within a  minute walk to canary wharf station and shopscant get more central than this,3/5
10,the hotel is a little dated but good value for london clean and tidy friendly service from staff but no daily room cleaning but as only stayed a couple of nights this wasnt an issue great location  nearest tube station is within walking distance would stay again,4/5
11,for me this hotel is in a beautiful setting within london the layout of the website is so easy to view and the many pictures of every aspect of the hotel is outstanding the price of the rooms are very low for the facilities it provides and i was very impressed with the amount of information provided and is a definite yes to stay there,5/5
12,stay away the temperature in our room was  degrees after  hours and many trips to reception they gave us a different room the second room had black mould in the bathroom also two people working at reception were coughing her lungs out the woman from reception admitted that she had the flu she was not wearing a mask and she was not using a hand sanitiser a minute later she handed me the room cards,1/5
13,stayed here a couple of years ago i had an inside room this time and its so much better than the window rooms in my opinion everything was clean but a bit old fashioned for the price i paid you cant fault it other hotels in london cost  plus a night will deffo stay again if needed to as the location is brilliant for jubileeelizabeth line and plenty of shops and food options in the area,5/5
14,no windows and even in winter the rooms were boiling with no working fans or ac food was horrible and bland so even through we paid for breakfast and dinner we had to eat out adding extra costs saw a staff member being extremely rude to another staff member by pulling faces and snatching things from their hand saying things and the other one just looked sad and said nothing back fire alarm went of in the morning wakening people up welcome drinks include tiny fresh glasses of juice which are very watered down views would be great if the windows were turning green on the outside and havent been cleaned in what looks like over a year and the beds are solid and springy so sleep is hard with that heat and fire alarm,1/5
15,absolutely appalling service at this hotel i asked reception for an additional duvet and without even checking the staff immediately dismissed my request with a flat no their excuse the hotel is busy today this level of laziness and lack of effort is completely unacceptable especially when i booked two rooms and expected basic hospitality they didnt bother to look think or even careit was an outright refusal with zero professionalism or courtesyif youre considering staying here dont bother instead stay at the novotel hotel which is located just opposite youll get much better service comfort and professionalismsomething britannia hotel clearly lacks avoid this place at all costs,1/5
16,the hotel was nice and clean great location the breakfast coffee was good a small minus from the fake room upgrade i understand that they wanted to create an image of good service but this was just embarrassingall in all value for the money,4/5
17,i used to like this hotel but this visit it wasnt that good the wifi now isnt free and quite expensive  per device in the room and wifi in the lounge is also limited the room we got had a broken window so in the evening we started feeling cold and didnt even know the window cant be closed cause its broken when the person came to fix it which he couldnt he was very nice and offered us an upgraded room but still why even give that roomthe location is good and has some shops nearby very nice atmosphere the room seemed not that clean but for few days it was fine they also dont do cleaning every day its only every three days so thats another disadvantage,2/5
18,lovely staff very friendly atmosphere was nice and calm in the room decor was dated and furniture was tired and the carpets were in need of a deep clean or replacement the air conditioning was not working so was a toasty c so we had to use a fan,4/5
19,reasonably priced hotel in a great locationbreakfast is notably worth having especially if you are gluten free as they have a whole separate serving areathe room we stayed in was a lower floor room and although nothing wrong with it the lack of phone signal was a bit annoying and we werent about to pay for the wifi when we were there for a very quick stay maybe the hotel could consider this about these rooms and have some sort of extension of the free wifi that was available in the lobby area,4/5
20,do not book hereafter spending two nights without having any housekeeping service i addressed that to the receptionist they told me for whatever reason that they do cleaning only every three dayseven after three nights i still got no fresh towels nor shower gel or any room cleaningfor a  hotel at a rate of gbp this is an absolute nogodo not book here,1/5
21,stayed here due to location hotel was very busy as there was lots going on in london this weekend most hotels were very expensive but this was much more reasonably priced our room was lovely on th floor breakfast was good too staff seemed pleasant we were out all day so we just used the hotel for somewhere to lay out heads which worked out for usthe main thing which i know may seem silly was that the windows were filthy the windows in the restaurant were so dirty on the outside what would have been a nice view wasnt due to this same for in our room other than this overall a lovely hotel in a great location,4/5
22,our room was absolutely gorgeous no complaints about the roomwas beautiful metal spiral staircase which led to the room itself it was cosy very clean beautiful lovely balcony space the room had everything we could possibly need in a closet there was a iron ironing board fan dressing gowns and slippers toostaff members were very polite and welcomingbut i would definitely go again,4/5
23,rooms were fine just need a bit of tlc in some areas clean which is the main thing good selection of bathroom essentials supplied and plenty of towels temperature was pretty high but at least we had a working fan in the room however had a couple of strange interactions with staff firstly at reception the member of staff seemed puzzled that we had booked online and asked a colleague to help talking quietly with each other and looking at the screen leaving us stood there worrying briefly instead of explaining the situation to us then as we were leaving the next morning the cleaner knocked on our door and was stood outside our door waiting to get in this was  minutes before checkout time so we left plenty of time i havent ever had a cleaner knock on my room door before the checking out time so that was an awkward first time experience,3/5
24,had  visits here recently and both times a different experience first visit checkin was disappointing the gentleman who served us was not the most accommodating and lacked in customer service training nd visit much improved where the young lady greeted us with a smile and was very informative of our stay again with the rooms first room was in the basement with no windows please if you can afford to spend more money do so as the basement rooms with no windows are depressing so i would recommend anything from st floor upwards nd stay was on th floor with much better views although windows so not open which again was disappointing as the airconditioning can get a little stuffy at times overall for the price and location not a bad stay but we were only visiting for work so no real complaints,3/5
25,stayed here for one night as a short stay it had all i needed i could see from one night though for a long stay it could pose uncomfortability rooms were fine slight out of date feel to the whole building but comfy and liveable in the room i was in i didnt order food nothing jumped out to me the downstairs eating area didnt look inviting and many other reviews state the averageness of the food staff were kind and helpful stashed my bag for the day free of charge a lot of other staff looked a bit on edge and i overheard a few having arguments or looking in a constant state of annoyance people do have days like this and honestly not a big deali would suggest booking here for a night or two its a good price for its location you can get anywhere around easily through the underground stations nearby for any more nights book yourself a slightly more expensive room somewhere else and have a proper nice stay,3/5
26,wonderful stay and excellent servicewe had a fantastic stay and the staff was incredibly helpful special thanks to assish the night manager who went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable the room was clean spacious and the overall experience was great highly recommend this hotel for its exceptional servicethis version keeps it short and omits the room upgrade,5/5
27,the worst hotel ive ever stayed in and ive only been in it  minutesthe toilet still had the previous occupants urine in it the door had an open keyhole to the outside the mattress might as well not exist and the rooms look like something out of  dreadful utterly dreadful worst decision ive ever made if i wasnt so tired i would go elsewhere,1/5
28,oh dear oh dear just come back from a few days in canary wharffrom half an hour checking in to the disappointment of the smeared glass framing the viewsthe britannia really surprised me for mostly the wrong reasonsfor  per night we had a grubbytired room with old fixtures and fittings and a dirty bathroom with a shower head over bath with a poor pressurethe bed was two singles bolted togetherhence had the gap between us so couldnt lay in the middlethe tv was a small analogue not opposite the bedas for the windowsgrimey and misty obscuring the view over the thameswe had to complain to receptionand the lady swapped out room for an identical onewhich we rejectedafter speaking at length to the managerwe eventually spent our last night in an executive suitewhich was spaciouscleanwith a comfy double bed and large smart tvhowever the bathroom was still way below expectations for a room of this qualityseeing as this hotel is on the thameswithin canary wharf i would have assumed clean windows inside and out were a necessity rather than a request everything was musty and old with apparently little investment within this hotelwe opted for breakfast one morningand for pp you get canteen style food of the most basic quality with essentials all of which fall well below averagewe since found out that the britannia hotel chain houses asylum seekers and other people awaiting processing before being moved on funded by the councilbumping up owners profitsit is important that residents of this establishment realize this is a basicunderfunded budget hotel being propped up with government fundinga really poor example of a hotel in an area of much better quality establishments,2/5
29,stayed here many times and without fail the fire alarm goes off during the night tired decor frazzled but very polite staff doors slaming through the night its not great but the price is on point when you compare to whats around plus point is the room service beats some of the higher rated hotels fast edible reasonable price,2/5
30,the hotel is falling apart lack of maintenance all over the place dirty walls poor hygiene the staff is really rude disrespectful without understanding what means to work in hospitality if you interact with them you can tell they are uneducated and rough they lack manners there is no communication skills at all between the front desk and house keeping in the mornings the house keeping team goes through the corridors shouting they do not respect the do not disturb signs to the point i have to place a chair behind my door to stop them from entering my room during my stay there was a guest complaining that some items were missing from his room the management was telling his the hotel is not responsible the place is old and you can see signs of deterioration the decor is awful somebody colour blind was in charge of designing the rooms avoid avoid avoid at all cost across the street is novotel and half block down the road is the hilton in comparison they day and night,1/5
31,britannia international hotel a living nightmarestaying at the britannia international hotel was nothing short of a traumatic experience one that i wouldnt wish on my worst enemy from the moment i set foot inside it was clear that this place was on a slow agonizing descent into complete ruin the decay was palpable in every corner the entire building feels like its been abandoned for decades left to rot as time chips away at what little dignity it ever hadthe windowsoh the windows they were so caked in layers of filth and dirt i honestly couldnt tell if it was day or night outside it was like staring into a void you feel trapped suffocated by the grime as if even the view outside had given up hope on this miserable place my skin crawled just being in the room where a stench of old farts hung in the air like a haunting ghost and if that wasnt bad enough every once in a while the pungent scent of stale marijuana would waft through as if to remind you of just how far the hotel had fallenbreakfast im still recovering it was more like an assault on my stomach than a meal the socalled food looked as though it had been thrown together by someone with zero concern for human health watery eggs rubberlike sausages and bread so dry it could probably double as a sponge i swear i could feel my insides rejecting it with every bite it was the bare minimum you could throw on a plate without getting sued but i wouldnt even feed it to a stray dog the whole experience left me on the brink of nausea praying i could survive until checkoutand the staffwell im convinced they had no idea where they were or what they were supposed to be doing everything was chaos a bumbling mess of incompetence simple requests were met with confusion or outright ignorance to say they were unhelpful would be an understatementthey seemed to actively make things worse most of the staff appeared to be of indian origin but thats irrelevant when the sheer incompetence knows no nationality it was clear no one cared why should they the hotels already in the gutterin short the britannia international hotel is less a hotel and more a decrepit foulsmelling healththreatening black hole where joy and comfort go to die if you value your sanity and stomach i beg you stay far away youd honestly have a better experience sleeping on a park bench at least there you wouldnt be surrounded by the stench of failure,1/5
32,i hate leaving bad reviews but i felt i needed to share my experience so others can make an informed judgement i had the worst night sleep ive ever had in a hotel this is with ear plugs in noise cancelling headphones over the ear plugs and white noise playing at full volume the walls and windows are paper thin so you can hear every single creak whoosh and bang of the trainline the entire night all the bustle of the road is also audible as are other guests conversations through the walls and every time a door opens or closes in the corridor i came up to london the night before a big meeting so i wouldnt have to travel early morning but i would have been better doing sothe rooms are also freezing and when you put the heating on it just churns out musty cold air making it worse and colderthe bathrooms are dirty and stainedthe hotel is cheap for its location  which is very close to canary wharf elizabeth line and jubilee line and the staff are polite and do try hard but that it ishonestly just pay the extra money for another hotel and prioritise your health and sleep,1/5
33,no tv remote all the new tvs were ordered but were still waiting for the remotes to be delivered this is quite ridiculouslimited drink options there was a lack of drink choices and guinness was unavailable all weekcoffee from the bar if you fancy a coffee its served in a plastic beaker reminiscent of something for a child no proper cups are provided even upon requestpoor maintenance light bulbs blew one day and by the next day another had gone out from the same fitting clearly maintenance issues are not being communicated when rooms are cleanedroom cleaning schedule the most expensive rooms on the th floor are only cleaned every three days with no explanation provided fresh towels and toiletries are not automatically replacedexcessive parking fee the  parking charge is excessivemismanagement of belongings i had checked out for one day but extended my stay using the same room when i returned after work in the evening all my belongings had been removed management clearly did not check or think to contact me expensive wifi   for  hours far higher than most hotels payment policy the bar only accepts card payments cash is not acceptedsleazy there were numerous prostitutes operating in the area and on one occasion my room was adjacent to one of their rooms,2/5
34,i had the unfortunate experience late last night and this morning to wake up to a room wreaking of cigarette smokeit had somehow traveled through the bathroom vent i have asthma and am highly sensitive to cigarette smokethe front desk staff helped me change rooms and the new room doesnt smell at all the unfortunate things is a now how a cough and a bad taste in my mouth to start the dayfelt last nights stay should have been comped our offered another nights stay free,2/5
35,if i could give this hotel a  star rating i would it was the worst experience of my life we checked into our room and decided to go out in london upon return to our room we discovered all of our belongings including ipads clothes hair tools and other equipment had all disappeared we went down to reception to report it and the staff had a look at the cctv it turns out  trespassers had broken into our room and stolen all of our belongings the first thing the hotel did was try to make it out to be our fault how did they know they were trespassers we phoned the police and had to wait in reception for  hours until they turned up this was about  am at this point the whole time we were down there not one member of staff asked if we were okay or even offered us a drink when i asked for a cup of tea she said the tea wasnt available but i could pay for a bottle of water behind reception which is an absolute joke after we had spoken to the police we asked to move rooms because the police needed the room for investigation and also i didnt feel safe staying in it when speaking with the reception about this they wanted to charge us to stay in the other room and also couldnt understand why we wantedhad to move rooms we had an argument about this because obviously we didnt want to pay for a new room when our room had just been burgled in the end we got a room at about  am the hotel staff were very very cold towards us didnt offer any support didnt ask if we were okay and better yet didnt even offer us any sort of money back compensation or free food or drink in the bar they are absolutely disgusting and i wouldnt wish my worst enemy to stay there,1/5
36,one of the worst experience ever they claim to be  star hotel they lack basic facilities such as cleaning they dont offer wifi in rooms and if you want then they ask for extra charges no daily cleaning of roomsno window in most of rooms for window rooms they ask to pay extraroom cleaning done only after  days that to on request not to waste your money by choosing this hotel minus  rating,1/5
37,great location in canary wharf london nice hotel clean and tidy room was big clean and tidy but furniture was a bid dowdy and old fashioned bed was uncomfortable staff on reception were quite rude but bar staff were very friendly hotel is in a good location,4/5
38,beautiful hotel right on the river literally a  minute walk from canary wharf tube station everything about this hotel was perfect the food was great the staff very friendly and helpful and it was immaculate the only thing we werent happy with is that the window in our room didnt have a handle it had been opened very slightly and we couldnt close it meaning we heard a lot of noise from traffic at night we did report it but they didnt manage to close this before we left would definitely recommend it for a london stay we are going back again,4/5
39,i am writing this review in front of the hotel its thursday night and im supposed to check out on monday morning but this place is utterly disgusting ive been staying at britannia in a business trip and i had to leave the hotel saturday night for a few days to attend some meetings outside london i clearly put in a signed request for my room to be cleaned and i come back today to find it filthy the towels have stains on it the place smells and i added a video on how i was closing my window please watch it this place is horrible how could they not clean for almost one week i would not recommend and definitely wont come back even though in your booking will say that you have free inroom wifi you wont its only available for the small price of   for a day for wifi if thats not crazy i dont know what is oh and the remote didnt even had batteries lol dont waste your money,1/5
40,our room was absolutely gorgeous no complaints about the room upon opening the door the was beautiful metal spiral staircase which led to the room itself it was cosy very clean beautiful lovely balcony space the room had everything we could possibly need in a closet there was a iron ironing board fan dressing gowns and slippers toostaff members were very polite and welcomingjust be aware that there are seagulls nearby and a train station so its probably best to have the window closedbut i would definitely go againalso the parking isnt amazing but with the space that they have its fineon our second trip in the room we couldnt pay for parking my partner had to go outside the hotel and pay so it may be worth paying before you get to the roomour room was different this time but absolutely fine great fans,5/5
41,mixed bag the hotel is adequate for its facilities and services however it is in an excellent location for canary wharf and it is priced realistically i use it a lot for my work in the city  mins total into bank via dlr it is perfect for exploring canary wharf at a great price,4/5
42,terrible experience  avoid this hotel at all costsi stayed at this hotel on july th  and my experience was a nightmare when i arrived the reception staff asked for my vehicle details which i provided as the booking supposedly included free parking imagine my shock when i returned home and received a  fine from parking eye their parking companyi contacted the hotel several times with proof but they were absolutely unhelpful even after reaching out to parking eye they refused to cooperate after weeks of stress and hassle i ended up paying the fine just to avoid more legal troublethis hotel clearly doesnt care about its guests and their incompetence will cost youliterally do not stay here unless you want to deal with the same nightmaresave yourself the headache and stay far away from this place,1/5
43,fire alarm going at  in the night and the staff just tells you its broken just give it  minutesbesides that no towels in the bathroom no staff at the desk drinks are expensive and the location which wouldve had great views is impossible to see cause theres filth everywhere and none of the windows are clean,1/5
44,spent a weekend for a break with friends needed a good rest shower warm bed and peace and this was what we got with this lovely hotelthe rooms were spacious enough for us to stay over into the night and catch up will defi ately stay again,5/5
45,alice hotel within walking distance of canary wharf tube station the breakfast is good and plentiful i think the hotel should revise its security measures for the dining room as we experienced  freeloaders getting a breakfast on the house even after being asked to leavesomething could be done about the room doors the door closers slam the door in the last  inches this woke us both up during the night,5/5
46,not up to the standard it should be or want to be shown as room has no wifi no fridge or minibar no hairdryer no water bottle bathroom door with scratches all over  you wonder if a an animal was left in there bits of paint coming off the wall and not even the cheapest room either so definitely will not be back,3/5
47,worst hotel experience i have ever had firstly you arrive to an entrance which is a building site no ramp or disabled access they took  minutes to check in the couple in front of mewhile other staff made themselves look too busy to deal with actual guestsdespite standing behind said couple they dealt with two other sets of guests before addressing me when i presented my payment card with a name matching the bookingas detailed in email confirmation they demanded photo id which was a hassle because it was buried under a mountain of luggage i was told that i could have stolen the payment card having duly presented my passport and driving licence i casually commented that they could learn a thing or two from the travelodge check in procedure which takes  minutes the duty manager then announced that he would not be honouring my booking leaving me a middle aged woman stranded in the middle of london with no accommodation for the evening,1/5
48,me and my partner stayed at this hotel for  nights we did not get any room service no clean towels or bedding no toilet paper etc we also had no windows and said we could get a room with one for an extra  the room was humid and struggled to sleep due how hot it was despite us using a fan and aircon we also were bitten by bed bugs and had bites all over our bodies however it is a lovely view once leaving hotel and was close to the canary wharf underground just a shame we had no service and how unbearable the room was,1/5
49,nice hotel excellent service rooms are dated but very clean staff are excellent couldnt do enough for you evening meal and breakfast was excellent all buffet style and plenty of choice would use again and car parking attached,5/5
50,booked two rooms from dec dec   in one room the heater did not work so we were moved across the hall to a new room after one night three nights in a row the fire alarm went off for approximately  seconds at midnight then on the morning of the th it went off multiple times staff were unable to provide any assistance nor explanation for fire alarm misfunction,2/5
51,went there this year and the hotel is just cheap and im not talking about the rooms theyre ok im talking about the way the staff treats its costumers despite being in the business of hospitality this hotel displays very little of it,1/5
52,lovely stay here staff were lovely and our room had a vintage feel to it which we really liked would stay here again would recommend,5/5
53,honestly i never write reviews but this place was horrible we arrived and did get a free early check in which we were super happy about we arrived on the second floor and the view was obstructed the garbage had the last peoples stuff in it old gross towels on the floor beds were made thankfully and we found some clean towels the hall ceiling had severe water damage and the rooms didnt have air conditioning or a window to open we were too exhausted to even complain and when we check in the staff were rude and didnt even crack a smile the hotel buffets looked below par for the  per person price tag however the lounge was nice and offered free wifi which the rooms didnt offer unless u wanted to pay  honestly i would recommend being excited for the cheaper price pay a little more and go somewhere in a nicer area with nicer staff and accommodations with wifi and air conditioning,1/5
54,good location walking distance to canary wharf underground transportation is good rooms without windows i would not recommend booking it is underground room very small no mobile phone signal no free wifi reception was not willing to help changing to a different room but ready to change if i pay upgrade fee though rooms available no complimentary water bottle when asked reception rudely said buy there no complimentary,3/5
55,one word runill separate this into three categories  unnecessary fees  conditions  cleanliness and  service theres a reason that the  reviews are scams or one night stays no laundry no pool no gym dont believe the google pics fees that come out of nowhereextra for wifi  pounds per day per device  for dinner that does not include drinks other than water you have to pay extra for juice at dinner ps  the food is always bland meat is tough  for the same bland english breakfast  pound charge added to all room service orders for tray fees and tiny portionsif you have all three meals in the hotel plus wifi on your phone and computer youre looking at an extra  at least per day cleanlinessroom service only comes once every  days and you have to request it in advance it showsthe toilet didnt work in the first room would not flush properly i moved to another room and to my surprise the sink flooded and wouldnt work a kind gentleman from the front desk attempted to unclog it accidentally splashing himself with soapy water he and a few other lovely staff members were honestly the only good thing about this placethe sheets smelled so musty and bad in the room that i had to ask for them to strip the bed completely im pretty sure they had fluffed up the bed with someone elses sweat and musk still in there cozy right servicei preface this with saying some members of the staff are absolutely lovely and i dont think some of the fundamental issues are with the frontfacing staff but more with management if they had better conditions to work in even the less pleasant ones likely wouldnt have to be so stern and defensivethat being said every request took hours i mean that literally you have to constantly check in on every request you make moments after returning my key card i asked to go back in to retrieve my charger i was told that staff was not permitted to go into vacated rooms without housekeeping  what type of policy is it that the receptionists and managers cannot enter a vacant room without housekeeping i waited in the lobby for about an hour went on a walk came back still heard nothing i return to the desk hours later only to be told that the housekeeping team went home but they had seen nothing in the room hope someone theres enjoying my charger at leastso i left this hotel down a charger feeling like i needed a shower and with an unnecessary hole in my pocket location is the only plus go somewhere elseall in all you end up paying for so much in extra fees and in the stress caused by service and cleanliness that you might as well upgrade to a nicer hotel or find a slightly farther location,1/5
56,fantastic hotel in the modern part of london surrounded by skyscrapers when you cross the nearby pedestrian bridge the subway entrance is  feet away at jubilee park at christmas time lots of decoration in the lobby and in the breakfast restaurant,5/5
57,bad experience from the get go went to check in and had loads of fees thrown at me due to having my dog staying with me with no explanation as to why i was paying all these fees i explained to the person checking me in that i was disabled and that i need things explained to me verbally but he chose to ignore this got to our room and it was boiling hot we turned down the air conditioning but this didnt do anything and we had to use the fan provided in the room went down the next morning to ask for something to be done about this but nothing was done and i had to go down again in the evening and they then sent someone up to open the window went down to check out the next day and explained to the person on reception that i was checking out and that my deposit for the dog needed to be sorted out this was completely ignored and i had to repeat myself and reexplain that i was looking to get my deposit back for the dog lady on reception refused to do this until housekeeping had looked at the room i explained that we were in a rush and that we had a train to catch but she didnt care about this  minutes later after housekeeping had been up i then got my deposit back very upset with the poor communication and customer service received by staff at this britannia ive stayed at britannias in the past and never had this many issues or such poor customer service and wont be back again soon,2/5
58,reasonable priced hotel considering location  canary wharf  and connectivity  minutes walk to the nearest metro stations jubilee  elisabeth line good accommodation option if need attend any exhibitions at excel free wifi but only in the lobby in the rooms wifi paid   hr rooms ok i really appreciated a proper bathtub in my bedroom,4/5

60,an evil spirit lurks the corridors of this hotel having been a psychic medium for over  years i know evil when i feel it as soon as i entered this establishment the hairs on the back of my neck stood up i could hear whispers from the spirit realm immediately trying to conversate with me after sorting out the paperwork i checked into my double room i had plans in the evening so i dropped my bags off and headed out when i arrived back in was approaching the witching hour i entered my room and felt the presence of an aggressive dark entity the entity was playing with the electrics in the room the lights were flicking on and off and the television kept changing channel i tried to summon the spirit so i could get some rest but it was having none of it i lay down and was aggressively scratched by the demon that was enough for me i checked out just after am please folks do not enter this hotel for your own safety,1/5
61,booked into this hotel for a couple of days reasonable location on canary wharf public areas look okbut on closer inspection it starts to look a bit shabby worn fittings carpets room furniture dated and worn toilets in foyer hadnt been cleaned in two days  photo taken on  will not be returning,3/5
62,as we entered room  we need to charge our gadgets but none of the sockets were working for charging we are using universal charging adaptor which we successfully used in another london hotel without any hassel but your  hotel which i really doubt now were unable to provide even charging facilities so i made a call to reception for resolution of problem instead of sending someone to my room i was made forced to go down to reception instead of booking a complaint note that we just checked in didnt have bath even and freshen up and had to rush again at reception i was told that we are given another room no  on th floor as problem could not be solvedso we packed bags again and moved to room no  but same problem was there and not even intercom was working there and couldnt even make a call to reception now is this ur  hotel where reception couldnt be even approachedagain without even having freshen up i need to go back to reception and elaborate the problem we returned keys of  and again came back to room no  and called reception but this time nobody was there to reply so i again went down to meet manager and then onduty supervisor said he is coming to room again we had to move as supervisor camesaw n said all these sockets and are newly installed but perhaps not checked whether working or not he was finding faults at our adaptor universal charging adaptor and phone but not the hotels fault he again made me to step down with adaptor to reception to check it in another socket  and the adaptor was working so he said u can come do charge anytimenow is this the solution where one has to go down for charging so i said nohe said anything couldnt be done to solve the problem until at pm electrician comes then he said i cant do anything if u telling meis this the way to address the guest s complaint he said at  pm one electrician will come so again i had to move down to meet and elaborate problem he came up with me and said i am seeing this sockets for the first time so hotel didnt even gave training how th sockets used whether they are working or not with universal adaptor and just installed how such mistakes can a hotel make that without checking it allots rooms and then say sorry for being unable to change socketswas it out fault that we choose britania for stayat  he gave one socket that worked but  guest had  mobiles  smart watches  ipads to charge so only  adaptor between  gadgets how do we do thatas we have to move early in the morning everyday only  gadget charged at a time and we suffered a lot for keeping fons off i proposed manage to cancel our booking as we didnt want to suffer without fons so he said refund will be after  days so after paying such a huge hotel booking fees to you even credit card limits were over so how we can move to another hotel if u cant immediately refund and we could not even cancel booking so basically e were trapped in a hotel were charing sockets were not even there and we had to keeps fons and gadgets closed now a days all have business and personal fons separate so need to be in touch with with family business fon had to be keep it and had to bear loss of many transactions on bussiness fon on next day the keys of our rooms not working so again had to rush the reception he said your room is showing as  and not  we were not been allowed to have drinking water in our bottles from restaurantnow this was really disgusting how it can be when we returned the keys of  in  minutes only as the same problem was also therehe said yes you returned keys of room no  but the receptionist forgot to updatehow this can be taken grantedeverytime we had to go down then what your staff is doing honestly if u cant provide even basic facilities as charging sockets how can u claim your hotel as  and charge so high for the same  and even after paying one has to be keep gadgets off and had to bear economic losses as well,1/5
63,worst hotel everfrom the outside looks it could be nice one but as soon you get in you can get not a great vibe the receptionist are very rude and useless so is the manager worst customer servicethe room is disgusting and stinks no window no wifi no good signal on the phone and the mattress is really uncomfortable you can feel the springs all over your body and squeaky every time you move and also room is not soundproof you can hear literally everythingone of my worst experience in an hotel is you call it sowill never come back,1/5
64,i so badly wanted to give this hotel  starsoverall bloody brilliant the hotel besides its colour is beautiful inside and out with an amazing gothic lobby filled with chandeliers onermants and a very well looked after yamaha piano reception staff very friendly upon my arrival i chose not to eat dinner at the hotel however there was an array of eating areas and a bar in the morning breakfast was fantastic it was a buffetonto the roomsthe doors had contactless entry readers with keycards and my room in particular was room  on the seventh floor with reddish curtains a blue wall behind the bed and huge window a big dresser and desk in front of the bed two bedside tables both with lamps and treble plug socket capability   standard uk  usb a  usb c at either side plus there were plug sockets dotted around other areas of the room too a huge bathroom with a bath and the entire room was very clean there was an air con unit in the room and a fan each room is equipped with a telephonethe only downside is you have to get staff assistance if you want to shut the window which i did because of the noise outside so maybe britannia could fix this so guests are able to operate themoverall fantastic stay especially considering some of the reviewsto sum it up cheap cheerful basic,4/5
65,it was really a bf experiment they gave me a not clean room and i must go back to the reception to ask them for another one and they gave me  they never cleaned the room or changed towels or blankets they never took the trashthey leave u like that until u check out  they have conserge but just to put ur luggages there they have no idea about reservations in the city or orientation staff is weak in communication with guests i will never go there again,1/5
66,i had a bad experience with the hotel reception and concierge service had a flight to catch very early hours of the morning after waiting for  minutes to get the cases down to the reception they eventually came out to say they do not provide for concierge service i had to move  suitcases one after the other by myself and they were just looking till i finished moving the cases,2/5
67,if i could rate this place a  i would  first of all disgusting hotel with filthy rooms  my bed was bumpy and disgusting and there was no shower head in my room on top of all of that my belongings that where left in my room where stolen by house keeping and the staff and manager where so rude and disrespectful that they swore and shouted at me over the phone  the manager adam was so rude that he caused me to sue this hotel  steer clear ,1/5
68,i had booked three rooms and in none of the rooms the ac was working properly when i went and complained i was told that maintenance person was not onsite and the repair will be done only next morningall the three days during the day time the ac didnot work only at the night time it would work for certain time miraculously the rooms were never cleaned i was told that the room will only be cleaned after  days which was shocking to heari stayed for four days and not even my bin was cleaned i had to throw my trash everydayi think these are some very basic things that a customer expects and the otel should definitely look into,2/5
69,excellent location and great view but rooms were a bit too old i kept hearing some kind of machine noise all the night,3/5
70,only the location is goodhotel rooms are really pathetic and unhygienicthey gave us a cube sized room in basementwe had to upgrade but still the lifts stink so badcarpets are really filthy and furniture of rooms is brokenparking inside hotel and internet both are availed by paying additional cost,1/5
71,professional regular client who spends the weekend regularly at  this britannia international hotel almost every weekend is very disheartened and angry today because of the lady called samira on the reception who clearly has no etiquette of how to communicate with customers i phoned from my room at  am to request a late checkout for  instead of am firstly the telephone in the room was not working the wire was ripped off i had to contact bookingcom to connect me to britannia hotel samira answers the phone and is so damn rude shouting and saying that if i wanted a late checkout then i need to come down to the reception to make a  payment  first a measly   could have been taken out from the card details held by them as done previously or waited for me at am  it really was not a big deal the reason i wanted a late checkout was because i was on an international work phonecall meeting and there was a possibility it was going to run a little late bearing in mind im still in my pjs could this silly girl not take the payment over the phone and understand my predicament instead of bellowing down the phone expecting me to run to the reception totally defeats the object if i was a manager i would definitely not be hiring her she puts off the customers ridiculously anyway i ended up winding up my meeting and rushed to get ready to check out at am amd went to the reception to speak to this samira and the manager of the hotel the manager was not the hotel manager he was a newly appointed team leader who clearly did not know how to resolve this issue seriously lacking in communication skills with too much hand movements ive always booked through booking com legitimately may i please note that as i come most weekends this hotel always asks me to book directly with themnot a good sign why would they do that its still the same price for me but id rather be protected by bookingcom  i will not be taking this matter lightly and there will be further investigation into this by booking com regarding the handling of this matter,1/5
72,the fire alarm was accidentally triggered multiple times at am two nights in a row not a pleasant experience hotel location good for visiting canary wharf and a short walk from the underground,2/5

74,please read this before booking this hotelthe ac does not work during the day they shut it off on purpose its almost  c and its boiling in the room reception does not pick up the call i went to the reception and they said there is no ac in my room at all except the ac starts to work every night miraculously so i called the hotel from my phone number and told them id like to reserve a room and i asked them if the ac was working in all the rooms  and they said yes then i told them that im staying in room no so and so and that they have been shutting off the ac during the day and their reply was sending a second fan to my room i had already complained the previous day as well and they had given me a fan another time i had a lot of groceries with me and had walked for  minutes and was visibly tired and sweating and my key card stopped working so i went back down and the girl at the reception mirudula made me stand in a long queue of almost  people checking in just cuz my key card stopped working im halfway through my stay now ill post another review if theres anything worse that they do would not recommend even to my worst enemies,1/5
75,had a lovely  days and night stay over christmas room was perfect great views hotel staff were lovely and the food was amazing thank you for a lovely stay ,5/5
76,many people put one star just because the hotel is not as fancy as a tacky  star one with golden door handles however britannia is very clean personnel is nice and friendly always ready to help at any time food is great with an affordable price we had our room with river view and rooms have air conditioning system that works very well beds are comfortable when i lost my wallet in the common living room i found it the next day straight on my bedside table as one of the cleaners had collected and left it there our stay couldnt be better i definitely recommend this hotel,5/5
77,i always like staying at bih but on this occasion my stay was spoilt by the refusal to allow a late checkout  something that had never been a problem previously the management did not handle the situation well,4/5
78,its a lovely georgian hotel the rooms are clean and well presentedthe beds are a little basic from a comfort perspective but perfectly fine for a night the pillows too could be improved but are fine for a short staythe service is very good the location ideal for getting in and around the wharf and travelling to stratfordthere are gorgeous little georgian details and styling everywhere its well lit easy to navigatethe shower pressure was really good although the showers themselves were quite basicthe breakfast was fine plenty and well prepared and the cost of the room was very reasonable for londonwould stay there again if we were budgeting and needed a quick stay,4/5
79,clean but old and tiredcharging for wifi in bedrooms sets the wrong tone  hard to believe they think this is worth doing i felt instantly annoyed on arrival,2/5

81,beautiful clean but a bit outdated and no free wifi which is horrible for travellers  a day if you want to connect per device we had to sit in the lobby to be able to check mapsplan our dayreceive messages,4/5
82,good location went to the o for an eventcheck in people werent rude but werent very happy either or nicehad to pay  extra for a room with a window because ours didnt have one that price is abit steep in my opinionrooms clean and okay bit outdated but finebut air con boiling obviously cant open our window we paid  for and we tried to turn the air com down but it didnt changed so sweating all night would of been an okay cheap night stay but too hot and overpriced window,3/5
83,we stayed here the night before jetting off from gatwick so the location was spot on the staff were friendly and we checked in with no problem the rooms were a bit dated but clean enough the car park was busy but we got a space did the job at a reasonable price,4/5
84,stayed here from th till st june  paid  euros per night not worth it at all they might argue and say it is central london prices but there are many places which are lesser than this shabby place and give you the value for money beds are so old and dirty the springs in the bed poke you when you sleep look out of the window there is a lot of dirt and the window panes have not been cleaned for ages there are stains in the bath tub next to the taps and in some places under the sink rooms smell and you cannot open windows poor ventilation rooms dont get cleaned at all probably once a weekall in all its not worth night never going to choose this place again no internet in the rooms and signals are weak so forget about getting online when you are in the room which you paid forsome of the staff are friendly and helpful appreciate them being nice to frustrated people,2/5
85,spent  days here rooms lovely and clean food plenty of choice and nice staff very helpful definitely recommend and would return very handy for tube nearby to get to central london,5/5
86,stayed here recently and i was a little apprehensive after reading reviews however i believe a lot of the reviews are really petty and from people who expect the ritz for a fraction of the cost first impression on check in was brilliant especially at how quick check in was we had two rooms which i looked at both and everything you could need was there including windows bar and dining areas were excellent and staff all seemed extremely helpful the chef was really attentive and hands on during dining and made sure everything was kept fresh and topped up waiting staff were all very polite and friendly views from the rooms were amazing especially at night when the whole area was lit up we had an amazing weekend and the hotel experience was fantastic looking forward to returning and seeing staying here again  to be clear im not a jet setting businessman im a normal everyday member of the public and this hotel ticked all the boxes,5/5
87,rude and unhelpful night manager jefferson put me in a room with no signal when i was on call and needed to be accessible by phone the staff have changed and they have clearly not been trained in customer service come back old team will not stay in this house of horrors again,1/5

89,this hotel is situated in a great location dlr undergrounds are nearby the reception team are very accommodating i was on the th floor which was west facing and providing a great view the hotel is great value for money clean and team very helpful would certainly recommend,5/5
90,beware if they offer a windowless room as they are in the basement and are tiny we booked a double but the room was at best a very small single the small double bed only just fits the room and a desk and chair made sure there was no space for two people to be comfortable at all we had nowhere to store our clothes but the bath was nice and clean our freinds also had a basement double room and thier bathroom door could not be fully opened as it hit the bed and a larger person would not fit through the gap at all  pounds for a night in a stuffy broom cupboard was shocking if wed known before hand we would have not stayed here at all,1/5
91,stayed there as part of an organised coach tour sunday night th august alright  breakfast good my room nice and quiet hotel attire tired but overall ok,4/5
92,this hotel is quite worn and tired some staffs appearancedress looks not professionalthis time when stayed in the hotel the receptions black lady gave me a key that does not open the room door and it also sounded like someone was actually already in the roomi went back to the reception to tell the same lady about the key being faulty and there seemed someone was already allocated the same room she then remade the key and asked me to go back to the same roomso i did but still couldnt open the door by this time i was certain that she double allocated the room to me and thats the reason why the key does not workso i went back to the reception and told her again that the key does not work she added  it seems to be an old problem that the keys sometimes do not work which obviously is not convincing at alleventually she gave me a new room although having me going through this and almost opened someone elses room there is not any sort of apology from hersuch a careless person they have in the receptionother than that i stayed in the hotel a few times before and have to say the rooms were clean  not the window and the shower was very powerfulif you did not experience any unusual drama nor do you have a high expectation for a hotel room then you would be fine in this hotelbut having a key that does not open the hotel room twice never happened before in my life,1/5
93,was asked to review this hotel but i cant as ive not stopped here and to me its a way of getting bullshit hotel reviews and apparently you get paid for it to me its wrong  as i could say its amazing and well worth the visit but people could go visit it and have a shit time so this is my review lol go visit and make your own mind up ,1/5

97,honest review ive got to say after reading reviews i wasnt expecting much im a bit believer of you get what you pay for i travelled with my disabled friend in a wheelchair the whole hotel was accessible our room was very large and it was spotless i cannot fault the cleanliness of the room the staff where very friendly and helpful breakfast was good pretty much what you would expect for a buffet breakfast it was a cheap  night break for us and it was fine for a base i would stay again,4/5
98,lovely hotelnever used the dining or any of facilitiespillows in room rather hardbut we werent happy as the  nights we stayed first night fire alarm went off a few times early hours of the morningthen the next night fire alarm went off  plus times at around am not ideal reallyhopefully the hotel sort the alarm out,3/5
99,we booked with caledonian coaches and were surprised at the size and quality of our room good size ensuite bathroom huge bed and a sitting area views of canary wharf from our window and room service excellent location few mins walk to underground station and really lovely kind staff we will be back,5/5
100,needed a cheap place to stay within a short walk of the jubilee line and this place ticked those boxes rooms are oddly decked out with oldfashioned fixtures and fittings despite being a relatively modern building the rooms could definitely do with a makeover but that said it was a comfortable nights sleep air conditioning was broken in my room but staff were very friendly and accommodating and got me moved to a new room instantly if youre looking for somewhere cheap to stay in canary wharf then this hotel is certainly worth considering,3/5
101,never get a room with no window there is no air and you will suffer i needed a walk at am to save me from an asthma attack the air is unbearable getting a second fan didnt cut it if you want the air of satans booty cheeks to send you into the most delirious state youve experienced pls purchase a new room here,1/5
102,acceptable only because its cheaprooms and entire hotel are very outdated theres a difference between well kept with a traditional design and seeming like its not been done up since the s this hotel is the latter it was probably once a grand hotel with its design but that has long gonebedside cabinets and desk all had broken drawers which either didnt open or had handles missing bathroom had clearly had work done over time but tiling was just filled with fillerheating in room was broken and stuck on  degrees but did hit  at one point asked reception and they said theyd send someone window being opened slightly was their solution but was far too hot and could barely sleep through the heat and noise would have been good to have been offered a different room instead of thats the best we can do by the lady who seemed unsure of everything at reception,2/5
103,great place for a familynice clean roomsopen to upgrades with reasonable extra costsbest customer servicegreat location  mins walk from the tubes,5/5

109,beauty view and well maintained rooms and i would like to appreciate haban who helped us a lot with the room services,5/5
110,i have received a message from someone i consider that it is not anyone from the hotel team and that they are using the hotels name to make scams please if anyone from the hotel team reads this make sure that this does not continue or if these people who contacted me are part of the hotel team you guys are reading this do not respond at all also who doesnt use paypal who prefers to use such a complex and delicate system to make payments really stupid i tried to see how far it went and obviously everything is a scam i looked for the photo of one of the scammers and it does not appear on google at all which makes me believe that it is a photo created with artificial intelligence adding that they do not have a visible phone number in the bigscam telegram account,1/5
111,stayed only one night but food was nice room was nice and beds were comfy staff very friendly no problem would go back,4/5

113,awful hotel fire alarm went off at am waking up everybody nobody would answer the reception phone leaving me to get dressed and go down  floors to find out from security that there was an issue with the fire alarm dodgy lifts that wouldnt close properly no vending machines anywhere on site to try and find a bottle of water  parking charges for two nightshow is this place functional in canary wharf,1/5

116,i recently stayed at britannia hotel canary wharf and couldnt sleep at all that nightthe emergency alarm went on  times between pm and am and when we called the reception they said it was all false alarm,1/5
117,first lets start off with the entrance the hotel is very outdated while this would of been a decent hotel back in the early s or late s this hotel is in desperate need of a remodel you have to pay extra if you want a window in your room there is a aircon control module on the wall that doesnt work but im guessing they thought it was okay because they supply you with  fans to circulate the hot air when checking in the hotel staff just seemed rude and walked away when i was trying to check in there is no free wifi unless you are in the lobby and the wifi is awful depending on where you are in the hotel there is no service in your room so you would have to pay for wifi which is  for  hours check out is am but someone comes around at am knocking the doors food is dreadfully expensive the hallways smell very nice novotel is across the road save yourself the disappointment,2/5
118,extremely small rooms with no ventilation no service was provided even when requested only good thing was the locationdefinitely not a  star not worth the money,2/5
119,you have to pay extra to have a window in your hotel room only supplied one room key staff very unhappy and unwelcoming felt judged hotel is very outdated not very clean hairs in the bed wifi is not free and not worth paying for lighting in the room is awful location is close to the jubilee line but took a while to find it it wasnt made clear that if myself yrs old and my sister yrs old would need for her id aswell as mine check in took longer than i expected we only stayed for one night but all these things complicated our already long day getting here,2/5
120,disgusting behaviour from a manger called adam who allowed his friend in a tesla registration gfwev to park in front of the hotel entrance and decided to give me attitude so because you know the manager you can park ever you want and have authority,1/5
121,hiwhenever i visit london  i have always stayed at this hotel because its situated in one the best locations in london my experience with this hotel has always been amazing for the very first time i was disappointed with the lady manager at the reception we had an issue regarding the power the lady manager was so rude to us and said if we had any issues we can go out of the hotel she literally said get out if we have issuesshe did not even hear us out she was so arrogant and said us she will cancel our bookings if we have problem with the staff we go to manager but what if the manager has so much arrogance and disrespect towards the customers to whom should we complain to  it was on st week of december we could see at the reception that the lady manager was rude and yelling at other customers too i think she needs to learn some manners to how to hear out people and be polite she is genuinely spoiling the reputation of the hotel how can she even be a manger apart from that the rest of the staff are very nice and cooperativethank you,2/5
122,lovely clean hotel only stayed  night breakfast was plentiful and tasty,4/5
123,the only good thing about this hotel is location it is in central of canary wharf the room was outdated like s i checked out  day early and the refund was not smooth i signed some card refund form and swiped the card but have to wait  days to get the money back wifi is not free in the room  per day it is free in the lobby but really really slow so dont bother just use the mobile data the parking is so horrible  per day,2/5
124,first  last time staying at this hotel once i arrived they informed me house keeping will do cleaning after four days upon request and i saw rat at reception area,1/5
125,very dreadfulwe stayed for  nights and they denied housekeeping for all nights no cleaningif we need anything need to come at the receptionno free wifi in the room only in the lobbycheck in time pm and check out  am and  if ask for an additional extra hour they charges  per hourvery bad,1/5
126,we had to book something quick and this was the first one that came up in a good location for us in london we paid  for a one night stay on a friday nightwhen we got to the lobby it looked dated but spacious and busy which we thought signalled a good stay  we were wrong the receptionist was friendly and nice enough so nothing wrong with the customer service however we couldnt find the room for the first  minutes because no one explained to us how the numbers workedthen when we finally got to the room it was windowless which reception told us which wasnt a big deal at first except there was no air con instead there was a simple desk fan that blew hot air across the room to add to this the room and hotel was boiling hotwe dumped our stuff in the room and went to the bar to get a drink there was a very limited selection of stuff available and the bar tender didnt seem happy to be there at all when we went to sit down the sofas on the lower side smelt very funny a bit like urine so we moved to the complete opposite side and ended up on a torn leather sofai mean if you want to be in a sauna for a whole night then book here i must have lost about lbs just in sweat from the night heat as well as tossing and turning we got up as early as we could and got the hell out of there never staying here again would rather pay more money to go somewhere else then this,1/5
127,rooms were filthy the curtains had dead bugs on them the floor was not hoovered and the room stank of damp window had an great view of the river but because of the curtains i avoided heading to the window terrible,1/5
128,pretty nice hotel right in the heart of the docklands only a few minutes walk from the station room was clean and staff were friendly and helpful would stay again,4/5
129,one of the worst hotel i have been to no wifi no aircon no fan rooms are bad dont book this hotel at all,1/5
130,in no way this is a  star property would not waste time in elaborating the miserable condition and facilities,1/5
131,probably not to everyones taste but i liked it you need to remember this is an old building on arrival the staff was pleasant considering the customer before me was rude the staff remained professional we were upgraded to the executive suite which was a lovely surprise the room was spacious and had a lovely view of the docks my personal experience i would definitely stay again as the building and interior had character however the carpet is dated and could do with a refurb breakfast was lovely and a variety of options the downfall mostly for me was parking it is extremely tight and small especially for the price i drive a large car and at one point i didnt think i could get out i did about  point turn we had to park  mins walk away to a hour car park which is again tight for large cars overall stay was lovely and fit for purpose,4/5
132,location great as was out the way of central london but with plenty of connections intothe city via the underground system only around a  min walk to the stations additionally right next to large shopping centre with plenty of places to eatrooms were clean and comfortable if slightly datedhowever the buffet style dining in jennys restaurant served a limited selection of bellow standard food which was often not hot enough the roasted meats were dry and tough the currys were too watery etci cant speak on the pizzeria or the room service as we didnt get either,3/5
133,room was good i had an executive staff were friendly and mostly helpful waterside is really nice only downsides were i seen a mouse in the dinning area assumed it was because we were close to the water still it put me off my foodanother slight is that each of the rooms online advertise wifi however when you arrive you will learn that you need to pay extra for wifi so while there is indeed wifi they pretend its free until you get there,3/5
134,fantastic hotel  great location and fantastic value for money highly recommended,5/5
135,was good stay a slight leak in passagewhich due to no maintenance only got worse ,5/5
136,we booked tour with caledonian to see elvis exhibition we was booked into britannia international hotel on arrival the hotel looked ok room was out dated then came meal times for the days we was there the food was cold i did asked the waiter to take it to the chef to tell him that the food was cold when i looked he had put it in the binthe morning when we was leaving i reported to the hotel manager justed went over is head this hotel needs better management waiters and chefs i shall not step one foot in there again,2/5
137,single beds are too narrow for me bus dlr and trains are available from the hotel stayed there from th may to th may no free internet in the room you can find free wifi on the lobby,4/5
138,this hotel is horrible not only the rooms are small but they also dont have air conditioning the bed is not comfortable the window is dirty the service takes  days to clean your room my recommendation dont ever go to this hotel only if you just want to sleep here thats it,1/5
139,my trip with my family was very comfortable britannia international hotel we achieved there happy memories very comfortable rooms staff also very welcoming and polite give five stars,5/5
140,pretty good hotel clean and tidy and in a great location reasonably priced too,4/5
141,there is no option for negative rating so forced to give  star i stayed in this hotel for days paid already so couldnt change the hotel no ac windows were open so all rain water was comingi used  table fan because i was melting in sweat no wifi you have to pay  per device per day  extra charge for room service no room cleaning before  days  that also you have to say  after request they will clean  so in short in days my room was cleaned only  times the worst soaps shampoos were kept in washrooms it didnt even made foam all of sudden room locks were changed so go to reception again  again to change keys just to enter your own roomthey mentioned double queen size bed but beds were not even single normal sizevery uncomfortable unreasonable charges for everything not even basic standards hotel,1/5
142,mediocre place and little transparency rooms are cleaned every  days outdated bath rooms no free internet in the rooms they try to charge for everything not a recommendable hotel,2/5
143,superb location for canary wharf lovely and big reception and decorated beautifully for christmas the rooms were very clean but old fashioned and i had a bible in my drawer breakfast was lovely but the buffet dinner time was disappointing but the pizza restaurant was good,4/5
144,very nice room lovely staff best hotel ive been to,5/5
145,wouldnt recommend hotel in general looks nothing like the photos decor is out dated some outlets were faulty shower only had two settings boiling hot or freezing bed was uncomfortable and half of the elevators were constantly out of service leading me to walk  flights of stairs walls are too thin and you can hear pretty much everything in the other roomsonly positives were the price and the customer service however that does not make up for the faults and other issues we hadwouldnt stay here again,1/5
146,its started as a disaster and ended as a disaster  the guest dying the need the booking number but to give id so then when i called the main guest to add my name to the bookings which they should have done before he doesnt just let me go to side in order to do a connecticut customer a favour and let them go while i do the email instead the rude reception says i have to queue again even though i politely stood aside while i was resolving so you sure you took me about  minutes and it was updated by calling and she just logged in through her email onto the booking and added my name maybe even just  seconds or  minute in that time they booked in another customer because i was in a short few tickets few minutes i should have been then dealt with because i had already cut for a long time completely stupid customer service how can you make a guest to queue again they all rates i could have just waited at the counter while i did the phone call and she added me through her email to the booking so make sure thats what you do if you got nowhere else to book enough to stay in the stupid place the rooms service was also really burned some guy comes in the middle of the night seeing the smoke detectors had been activated and then said its faulty and nobody was vaping or even had a shower he could be activated by a shower open door and there is knocking your door at  in the morning change to hub annosi he did not even ask to come in he just barged in lake hes stinging in a some kind of homeless hostel and its your support worker,1/5
147,i used to love this place now they dont take cash at the bar not coming back,1/5
148,the staff are very helpful and efficient but i was most impressed with the food it was delicious and an amazing price for a buffet for delicious food especially with some tasty red wine great views also had a perfect stay thank you ,5/5
149,felt like i was in the shining the mattress was really uncomfortable the carpets and furniture were really old the hotel had an overall funky smell to it really old fashioned like it was stuck in the s at best one of the acs was not working in the room and the staff could not do anything about it the view was decent and it wasnt too far away from canary wharf those were the only good things about the hotel ended up leaving early and going to another hotel because we couldnt sleep,1/5
150,the worst experience ever i have been charged for two nights when i only wanted one night they refuse to refund me room is dated and dirty reception were unhelpful and kept giving me information and then telling me later that this was a lie and giving me new information an awful nights stay i do not recommend,1/5
151,theres a sense of faded grandeur when you go in like how i imagine a cruise ship looks before its decommissioned the room is fine but again feels dated everything from the way the toilet flushes to the old mattress where you can feel the individual springsthe receptionist when we checked in seemed quite bitter she clearly didnt want to be theregreat value and location though,3/5
152,over all bad place but lovely breakfast i was asleep naked and i heard someone use key card and shout do you have a problem with your lights luckily the door is round the wall and i wasnt seen after this i felt very unsafe also my key card to my room would randomly stop working nearly every time i went out and would have to come down from high up to wait in queues at reception for it to be sorted quite annoying as i was late for my meeting no issue with bed or bathroom and room was clean but i will try and avoid this place in future as several others have said theyve had random people walk in to their room,2/5
153,awful do not stay i stayed in summer for meeting in london certainly not air conditioned as advertisedupdate i complained and was allocated a different room a lot more comfortable although past best youcan see previous grandeur which i love still clean and well presented if a bit shabby greatful for the room change changed rating from  to  stars,5/5
154,i have stayed here twice on two coach trips the staff are lovely and the food was really nice the rooms are done out in an old fashioned style to match the hotel with modern facilities like ensuite tea and coffee facilities tv etc some of the coach party commented it was a very posh hotel and felt privileged to stay there everyone slept well including myself it was a very comfortable stay i will be staying here again next year in ,5/5
155,needs improvements the included free internet is only available on the lobby floor ridiculous for  the hotel is extremely outdated and everything is worn damaged or needs replacementmaintenance room ventilation is extremely poor the window can only be opened by staff i had to request three times in one day a p and after p to get my window opened over priced for room and service providedwhat was good most of the staff were nice if the customer is understanding and realizes the issue normally isnt the fault of the individual staffer they can be accommodating,2/5
156,first of all i want to thanks adem ozer for everything he is very kind and solved all of my problems i understand why he got the best employee of month i dont understand why people gave negative feedbacks for this hotel the location is magnificent which is near to river side,4/5
157,location wise its great close to things you want thats where the good times endthe room was an internal room with no windows after a few hours struggled with the stale air and the smell of the seemingly centuries old carpets staff were fine on the one occasion we ordered a drink from the bar room wasnt cleaned in the  days we were there luckily we were in the room very little so didnt have to put up with how depressing the place is,1/5
158,please do not book here the rooms are tiny and musty the whole hotel has a general bad smell a rat ran across my room in the middle of the night i complained to the staff and they were indifferent i was put in a room in the basement with no wifi or phone signal i had to pay extra to use the hotel wifi overall a very bad experience the whole place felt dirty and made my skin crawl,1/5
159,when i booked this hotel i found so many negative reviews online but decided to go ahead as i had two strong pointers firstly the location was best secondly the connectivity to central london was amazing and during my stay i didnt regret my decision even once had four bus stops just  minutes walk away and four tube stations nearby plus pier from where you can hop on to cruise for thames ride this place has connectivity to dlr elizabeth line and victoria line which means you can plan bestest itinerary hotel was neat clean staff helpful and friendly i will not comment on food as they dont have any good options for vegans so i had all my meals from outsiderest i can vouch for this hotel for comfort and safety its quiet environment comfortable beds with clean linens helps one rest nicelymajor usp is good mall parks botanical gardens just  minutes walk away beautiful water bridge and cabot place mallbeing a solo traveller i loved this place and its connectivity to tubes and bus stops staff was good too,5/5
160,location  canary wharf service was quick easy and all the staff had a smile and were very friendlythe room was disappointing it was clean but the bed was hard and the shower just threw water all over the bathroom floor was like a flood had hit the hotel,4/5
161,nice location but the hotel is very dated had a basement room which wasnt the best right outside the bar so noisy very small room with no windows and low ceiling air con couldnt keep the room cool bathshower was ok but couldnt sit on the toilet unless sideways or with the door open at am and the cleaners came so on it was clean though i wont be staying here againmaybe a good cheap option for some and maybe good for a purpose but not for me,2/5
162,the single worst hotel i have ever experienced i have literally had a better time staying in the middle of downtown helmand province this tired run down overpriced dump should have closed years agothe aircon doesnt work half the lifts didnt work the furniture is falling apart the bar is overpriced with grumpy staff the desk staff at reception are slow theres no wifi the phone signal is terrible theres always a queue anywhere you go there were people sleeping all over the lobby on a sunday morningavoid at all costs absolutely shocking service and hotel at top prices youre better off joining the homeless people in the bridge just out the back,1/5
163,having read some bad reviews after booking i was hesitant about our forthcoming stay im glad to say we were pleasantly surprised we received a warm welcome on arrival our room the bathroom bedding and towels were very clean and the bath was huge good water pressure in the shower good choice for breakfast the only fault was the quality of the coffee i had juice but my friend said the coffee was not great overall a pleasant experience at this hotel would recommend as very good price,4/5
164,this looks very glitzy on entering the staff are helpful but not over the top the corridors leading to the rooms are dated  tatty as was the room patched up wallpaper which wasnt even the same colour stained carpet chipped skirting boards the bed was comfortable with a quilt that just about fit the bed so not ideal but for one nights stay it was ok breakfast was a choice of cereal toast cooked breakfast which was rubbery croissants but not really as they were doughy  not very nice to eat this could have been five stars if they just put in the effort with the rest of the hotel that they put into the foyer,3/5
165,room and hotel is a bit dated its in a great location i think its value for money and the staff were nice they gave me a free upgrade which was very welcome  yeah not ideal to pay for internet as an extra in this day and age not a deal breaker just a bit disappointing they feel the need to do this,4/5
166,first class hotel i booked for a week excellent facility and staff also,4/5
167,the staff is rude and arrogant starting with reception and continuing with the waiters in the breakfast restaurantthe hotel is very old and feels like old britain the lifts faucets furniture  all feels very ancient and full of history the breakfast is decent location is perfect rooms are fine,4/5
168,hotel is filthy dirty carpet is stained and looks like it hasnt been cleaned in weeks or months no wifi and no airconditioning room was  moved rooms twice due to broken fixtures in one room the shower head and hose were missing staff sulky and unhelpful,1/5
169,a dreadful start to a stayreception stafflady with glasses is extremely rude and unprofessional i complained abt wifi non functioning on the previous stayas they outsource their wifi service i was told to call the number on the bottom of the receipt and they have nothing to do with wifi then why do you rip off customers with daydevicea male staff from other side of the reception jumped in and said i was rudecus i made a complaint despite asking for the manager  his name the staff was hesitant to tellthis behaviour of your staff is patheticstay away from this hotelnever coming back,1/5
170,i know someone that used to work here the rooms are super old and the new ones dont have a single window they used to have a mouse problem in the kitchen and they probably still do after reading some of the reviews the carpet around the old rooms are extremely old and dirty breakfast used to be  but it is definitely not worth it some of the rooms dont have air conditioning or heating so they will probably offer you a fan or a portable heater if they have any left the general manager is an old men that clearly doesnt care about his employees if you need to stay for a night i guess its fine considering how cheap this place is but if you are planning for a longer stay go somewhere else,1/5
171,if you love to wait for hours in line this hotel in perfect for you upon arrival it wss  hours to check in everyday their system would check me out i would go wait in line again for an hour they would say sorry  re check me back in numerous times my key would stop working and go stand in line again for another hour they said they were changing computer systems but what a nightmare ive never waited in line for so many hours over the span of a few days only an apology from them as i was standing in line with everyone else that was having the same issue,1/5
172,rooms were decent but air movement was lacking the window didnt open very wide and there was no air flow from the system in the room the breakfast buffet had a lot of choices and well stocked the staff was friendly,4/5
173,location is pretty good canary wharf can be quite lovely thats where the good kinda comes to a stoprooms are very dated and uncomfortable furniture is worn and walls are dirty staff is borderline annoyed that youre there especially if you ask them for anything wifi is not free in the year of our lord two thousand and twenty three paid wifi oh and because i had to actually get some work done i paid for it i say again in the year of our lord jebus two thousand and twenty three seven pounds for three mb downour room which was upgraded from one of the basement rooms has a lovely view of a roof the doors to the rooms dont feel secure at allalso by dated i need to say dated like youre walking straight into the  cult classic the shiningwould not recommend unless youre a big jack nicholson fan and really want a heres johnny moment,2/5
174,amazing hotel customer service and good location will recommend,5/5
175,was a very spacious room and bathroom the rooms were clean and the temperature of the room was perfect and could be adjusted most of all the room had a large window and balcony with a v nice view,5/5
176,value for money is poor there are much better options for a similar price in the same location overall the stay was fine but it needs a refurbishment however no wifi in rooms is a joke as well as blood stains on the mattress bed sheets and another couple red stains on one of the towels,2/5
177,room was clean and tidy bed was average from a comfort perspective air conditioning was not functioning properly and so the room was showing c on the thermostat overnight so had a pretty uncomfortable night which meant the room rate represented poor value bathroom was spotlessly clean,3/5
178,rooms not cleaned daily  after having informed reception i asked the staff for a luggage scale which was broken and did not work all rooms need a revamp location is great underground is a few minutes walk from the hotel,3/5
179,my experience in staying in this hotel was mixed feelingsthe night reception staff were friendly and warm welcoming they listen and help you with your needsthe hotel decor was generally old fashion and feels that you are back in timethe room we stayed in was spacious and had the basic facilities requiredhowever i am very disappointed with the bed frame and mattress that needs upgrading urgently it was on wheels and the mattress felt very uncomfortable and the frame squeaking when i move position in bedthe bathroom needs refurbished as you can see mould very old victorian tilesthe room decor needs to be modernise and kept simple and bright it had artwork of random ladies and some inappropriate for any guest in my opinionthe ac and switches was very old fashion with vents that could be upgraded i am not sure if it worked properlythe view was ok my colleagues did not have any window and was disappointedparking is  whole day this is extremely expensive and should be paid by hotel as part of the room booking however location is very good heart of the financial sector canary wharfoverall would i stay here again politely noi would recommend ibis hotel or travellodge or a premier inn if you traveling into london for the weekend or short business  leisure break,2/5
180, review britannia international hotel londonthe britannia international hotel in london is located in canary wharf a modern and bustling area with good connections to central london at first glance the hotel impresses with its central location and proximity to public transport including the dlr and canary wharf tube station however upon closer inspection there are some weak points that cloud the overall impressionpositive location the location of the hotel is undoubtedly one of its biggest advantages it is ideal for business travelers visiting canary wharf tourists also benefit from the quick connection to attractions such as the tower of london or greenwich view some rooms offer great views of the river thames or the canary wharf skyline which can visually enhance the stay price compared to other hotels in the area britannia international is often cheaper making it attractive to travelers on a smaller budget breakfast the breakfast buffet offers a solid selection of hot and cold dishes that are sufficient to start the day although the quality of the products is rather averagenegatives condition of the rooms many rooms seem outdated the carpet is often worn the furniture is oldfashioned and there are reports of poor cleanliness such as dust on surfaces or mold in the bathroom the smell in some rooms also leaves something to be desired which may be due to an outdated ventilation system service customer service is mixed while some employees are friendly and helpful others seem disinterested or overwhelmed especially when there is a high volume of guests wifi in a city like london free wifi is now standard in hotels however at britannia international hotel this is often not the case or the connection is extremely slow noise level despite the soundproof windows many guests complain about noise particularly from other hotel guests or the surrounding area this can significantly affect sleep general atmosphere the hotel has the charm of decades past which may seem nostalgic for some guests but leaves others with the impression that it has not moved with the timesconclusionthe britannia international hotel has its strengths especially in terms of location and price if youre just looking for cheap accommodation in canary wharf and dont have high expectations of comfort or modern amenities you could find a suitable option here however for travelers who value cleanliness service and a contemporary atmosphere there are better alternatives in the areaoverall i would rate the britannia international hotel as a mediocre property that could become significantly more attractive with a renovation and a greater focus on guest satisfaction,3/5
181, nice hotel only  m away from the metro station nicely located by the water canal very nice views the rooms are modest but quite clean you must always let us know that we want the room to be cleaned if you dont report it no one will come to clean or change the towels for several days theres an influx of tourists on the weekend very crowded the breakfasts are quite tasty the same every day but you can easily find something for yourself the bar and pizzeria inside are of a good standard normal prices,4/5
182, very bad experience in this hotelit is too hot in the rooms so it is impossible to sleep not to mention the noise of the ventilation even when it is turned offwifi is paid shameful in  parking management is disastrous and it is very narrow impossible to turn around insideeverything is aging carpet decoration etc and the staff is not up to the standard they wish to displayi put a nd star just for the correct price and the location  minutes from the center by metro,2/5
183, i am sorry for the followingthere was not a single bottle of water in the room only two plastic cupsthe fire alarm went off at an unsuspected timeattention there are basement bedrooms  and  level where it is like a boat cabin they dont mention it anywhere on the internetthere is no service or room service of course down there we did not know that we would pay so much money to stay in the ministry with limited basicsagain the sheets and towels were clean,1/5
184, important the internet costs  per device daily embarrassing to be honestthere is a star for the friendliness and helpfulness of the employees and another star for the fact that the food tastes good however the  stars stop with the room first i was in a room where there was a constant short circuit a socket and the light  short circuit and the staff were helpful next day same thing again plus a fire alarm false alarm in the middle of the night half of the sockets didnt work the rooms are spartan with no decoration just walls sad since they are supposed to be  stars i was taken to another room the same thing there but no electricity problem anymore but neither the exhaust in the bathroom nor the heating worked it wasnt cold but it was cool in the evening i will never go here again,2/5
185, my friend and i were staying in a separate place but while i was gone my friend went out without his house key and it was discovered late at night i was staying in london as a tourist so i was in a lot of trouble because i didnt have anywhere to turn to and i didnt have a place to stay my friend was drinking at another place until morning but i was very tired that day had a lot of money with me and it was too cold outside so i was at a lossalso unfortunately my id was left in the room the owner of the house was asleep and unresponsive and worst of all my phone had no batterywhen i was at a loss for what to do i suddenly remembered this hotel and went to the reception i didat first i was refused thats right i dont have an id its late at night and theres no sign of anyonei think he looked like a very strange personi thought i was starting from square one again so i looked up the hotel on my cell phone which was about to run out of battery and i guess they took a picture of me feeling really bad lolthe staff offered me a room also the price was reasonable even though it was the day of my stay also they charged my phone which was a great example of their hospitality i was so grateful for that day that i wrote this review thank you very much if i ever have trouble getting into my house again ill come here lol,5/5
186, the worst hotel ive ever been to cleanliness is really a priority so blood on the sheet is unacceptable small hairs everywhere stains on the carpet we paid an extra  euros for a room with a window that was the size of a hand and looked at the pipes and the other wall people who work very reluctantly,1/5
187, very outdated hotel rooms oldfashioned and in need of renovation bad service not very accommodating terribly bad internet for  per day tolerable for two days no longer,2/5
188,  stars only for the location poor cleanliness breakfast not included  if you want to have it and no wifi in the rooms but only in the common areas old structure that needs to be modernized,3/5
189, excellent location since two metro lines have a stop within a minute walk which puts you at the main attractions in less than  minutes the area is very beautiful and there are many food options nearbythe hotel if you only want it to sleep in it is ideal for the price the beds are not the most comfortable and the chairs in the bar area stinkwe only stayed one night as it turned out since they took care of our suitcases from the moment we left am until the time we had to go to the airport pmfriendly staff,3/5
190, disastrousas part of a group trip  people this hotel was booked for  nightsvery attractive hotel from the outside but really very dilapidated insidethe following opinion is unanimously shared by all  people who made up our groupthe state of the rooms is deplorable and terribly degraded damaged doors dirty carpet stained bed linen the door to the bathroomwc does not close sanitary facilities and taps in very poor condition almost unsanitary bathtub in short there is enough to fear infectionwe stayed there for  nights and at no time were the room or the bathroom cleaned the beds remade or the linen replacedalso note unfriendly staff who receive your complaints with a smilenow lets talk about the restaurant buffet normally varied except that  consecutive evenings the buffet presented exactly the same dishes all you can eat buffet except that once the trays are empty there is no possibility of refilling it is therefore in your interest to have starter main course cheese and dessert in one go otherwise you will not be able to finish your meal and of course this will be to the detriment of the other customers of the restaurant another particularity too cakes which are still frozen when you want to help yourself and on the other hand ice creams exposed for too long and which are now only nonfrozen creamsin short a hotel to absolutely avoid,1/5
191, its horrible it smells bad dirty towels sheets with bad smell sagging mattresses the tv didnt turn on its like it was from the s not even the intercom for reception was useful nothing really works but it is occupied by travel operators to europe because it must cost them very cheap i dont know how the government does not regulate these types of hotels that do not comply with hygiene regulations and that must be  stars they even include maintenance sheets showing how bad it is,1/5
192, dilapidated hotel that smells like an antique shop floor to floor carpets throughout both in common areas and in hotel rooms dirty curtains with blood stainsterribly bad bed where you could feel the spring springs against your bodycleaning only after three nights we got cleaning after four nights and then we had to fuss ran out of toilet paper after  nights there was also no toilet brush in the toilet very boring not being able to clean the toilet bowl after yourself especially with so little cleaning in the hotelthe bathroom needs a proper washdown as it was dirty between the joints in several placeswe probably get what we pay for i get that and probably fine for just a night or two  not for  nights like we had,1/5
193, from the moment we entered we realized that the hotel is very very old with interest you say well it is something vintage but the smell of the carpet the bathroom and when we were leaving the hotel seeing a mouse between the area from the lobby to the restaurant area i didnt manage to take my cell phone to show evidence to the staff i hope they carry out a fumigation soon for the good of the guests acceptable food if you dont have high expectations wifi is super necessary but i wasnt going to pay for it it should be a resource provided by the hotel it was better to continue using my data plan i suggest not staying here if you dont want to have a bad time,1/5
194, what a disgusting placedirty rooms broken window open all night towels with dried human excrement and when you went to ask for another one they gave you others with more excrementthe beds with hair and bugs i woke up with bitesdisgusting foodand not to mention the bad weather that the hotel had,1/5
195, we booked into this hotel for a  night stayand we had to change hotels the next morningthe hotel does not deserve any stars our room was not cleaned we had to sleep all night with the window open because it was broken the wardrobe door fell on us when we opened itbreakfast is expensive and on top of that the buffet was emptyyou pay for parking even though there is no security where you roll on rolls of carpet on the groundthey charge for wifireally very disappointed with this hotelto flee,1/5

201, disappointingthe hotel has a good location but it really deserves  starwe spent  nights in this hotel at first we thought we were in a chic hotel but once inside it was a descent into hell exorbitant price for a room without windows no air conditioning or ventilation system what an idea to offer a room without windows it was impossible for us to stay after waking up because the smell of the mustinessheat was so stifling we reported cleaning of the room over  days and on our arrival no cleaning was done disappointing you have to pay to have internet in the room  if you have internet with your phone there are times when you will receive nothing for several hours i wonder if they dont use network jammersgo your way,1/5
202, i was at this hotel during the first week of july for a school study trip and it was a good experience you can find a piano a lounge a hightech coffee machine but for a fee  while the food was pretty good considering i only have breakfast in the morning there are eggs croissants bacon bread jam and butter in bags cupcakes cereals a free coffee machine the connection was pretty good even if it doesnt work in the room because you have to pay  for  hours and for a device but at reception its free,4/5
203, lousy serviceac in the room does not work all services must be booked  hours in advance the sink was clogged hard mattresses,1/5
204, the hotel is very old the room service is really bad the small offering is not completely available it is limited to frozen pizza why ketchup and mayonnaise are served is incomprehensible probably so that you can enjoy them the taste is a flat the windows are so dirty inside and out that no one has cleaned them for years and they cant be closed either this is very comfortable at night it doesnt even have a latch to close the air conditioning doesnt work the sofa stands on three legs and is unusableits the first hotel in my life without german tv which is standard on the other side of the world construction site and dirt in front of the hotelin short no no and no againnever again london never again this hotel,2/5

207, deplorable in every wayno cleaning of rooms or sanitary facilities food of poor quality and insufficient old and poorly maintained setting unfriendly staff move on,1/5
208, we booked the hotel in may from the th to the st and during this time the cleaning lady wasnt even with us the towels were neither changed nor was the room cleaned nor was our bed made it is much worse that the hotel is given  stars there is an extra charge for wifi in the room the hotel is getting really old the fittings are twenty years ago there is no usb port the hairdryer is in the drawer there is no fridge the windows are so dirty that you cant even see the view from the th floor when checking in it is rather annoying something is mumbled in english in a quiet incomprehensible manner and when you ask about it you roll your eyes basically not worth  stars,1/5
209, great location clean rooms but some are too small the pillows are terrible for me,4/5
210, attention null or disastrous they do not clean or replace toilet paper you only pay for more than  days a roll of paper and two bottles of gel for two peoplea bit tacky really the condition of the rooms is very old and the beds leave a lot to be desired,1/5
211, large and nice rooms lousy beds it is so hard and the springs feel so good that carpet on the floor was considered a better alternativewifi in rooms at an additional costno washingchanging of sheets and the like unless you ask for ithallways smell extremely of the spray you use on the toiletcheck out   per hour over max amazing listening you hear everything and everyone around you sometimes i thought our door was openlocation super in relation to canary wharfok place for a weekend trip,3/5
212, the hotel in general was quite goodthe price is what it is in all of london and the quality ratio was quite goodthe rooms are dated but clean with shower gel shampoo etcthe staff was acceptable i didnt really like the attention except for the breakfast guys who were friendliera pleasant stay nearby metro and a nearby shopping centerthe english breakfast is quite good they have vegetable milk for those who are lactose intolerant like merecommendedi dont give it a  because the wifi was paid i have been to hotels in india which all had wifi,4/5
213, the worst hotel i have ever been to dirty rooms bad service and bad attitude they charge you for everything even the internet and many of the staff are very rude everything is super old they ruined my vacation and stay in london the bed creaked because it was so old even though i was staying they didnt allow me to rest in the lobby which bothered me a lot,1/5
214, the first impression was good although marred by the very dilapidated access area the hotel forecourt is in absolutely poor condition and needs to be repavedunfortunately there was no concierge to welcome us and we initially felt lost in the lobbyour luggage was then picked up and we were able to take a look at the city before checking in at lunchtimefirst of all the most impossible thing for  here you pay for wifi per device per day an absolute nogo  a day at first i didnt think anything of it on the seventh floor we had very poor reception which was hardly enough to do anything useful with the smartphone daily research impossiblethe room initially seemed inviting and elegant in stylehowever upon closer inspection the furniture is very cheap and some of it is damagedthe bathroom has a bathtub with a shower curtain i expect more comfort for the price range this hotel lacks investment and renovation is at least  years overduethe air conditioning was broken and even after informing the lobby twice we were not helped and the problem solvedon the good points it is really excellently located and you can get to lcy and the city center quicklythe atmosphere in the inhouse pizzeria was nice and delicious the service couldnt be faulted either,3/5
215, bad experience they robbed us in the room when we left during the day when we complained they did not believe us and did not take responsibilitythe rooms are very old the mattresses are uncomfortable they were springs the heating didnt work the window was broken and all the cold air was coming in it couldnt be closed the room literally smelled like fishit wasnt just in my room we went with several family groups on a tour and all the rooms were like that the same experiencethe hotel food is terrible and it took more than  hour to bring me  pizzas and a pasta and they still require a mandatory tipwe decided to go buy food outside the next day we asked to borrow two forks and they told us that they could not lend cutlery for outside foodoverall a terrible experiencethe only thing that stands out is the location since it is quite central and the metro station is very close,1/5
216, very caring and nice service i had breakfast brought to my room i was also able to get help carrying bags at any time without any problemsi can highly recommend the pizzeria in the hotel it tasted very goodthe breakfast room has a great window viewabsolutely ideal for business people,4/5
217, if you are looking for a place of a certain standard this is not for you star very dated scenic lobby but thats all the good stuffneglected clean rooms i dont think so since if you dont ask for cleaning they dont do itfree wifi service only in common areas otherwise  per day per devicebreakfast not included cost  tried but very flat not satisfyingrestaurant if you are lazy and unpretentiousthe location despite being to the east of the city is convenient with the northern line station a minute walk away and the elizabeth line station  minutes away as well as the drl station inside the jp morgan skyscraperview from the room very romantic but it doesnt compensate for the rest,2/5
218, after reading the many negative reviews i was prepared for the worst it wasnt that bad the double room was sufficiently large and clean the furniture has seen better days but the mattress was neat and the joints in the bathroom were hygienic i always find carpeting in hotel rooms questionable but ive seen worse here too we didnt eat at the hoteli think the many negative reviews come from people who dont realize how bad many other hotels in london are,4/5
219, night without breakfast of course for a crap hotel old and dilapidated infrastructure and interiors stained and ruined walls window that does not close completely short duvet tiny shower towels in full disintegration they dont even do the room every day a disaster never againoh i forgot you have to pay for wifi in your room cardboard walls between rooms you can hear everythingtwo stars instead of one for the location it deserves,2/5
220, hotel  minutes walk from the metro strategic location the hotel lacks modernity but despite everything the rooms were clean and well tidy during my night stay two people entered my room opening with a different key than mine obviously even though i had also closed the door once in the afternoon and again in the morning resulting in a traumatic awakening they absolutely must improve the security of their rooms which must not be lacking in any way,2/5
221, the room lacks ventilation bad air and hotlousy beds and pillowstoilet brush and soap were missing in the bathroomthe corridors smell and are dirtysurcharge for wifi,1/5
222, our experience was very good they gave us a superior room,5/5
223, located in the financial center of london with many restaurants and facilities nearby the hotel also has a restaurant with good options on its menu the room i stayed in has very beautiful decor with a view of the thames i stayed two nights and there was no room cleaning service room facilities are old the shower is over a bathtub with a plastic curtain the breakfast is reasonable with few options there is a layout problem with the placement of the coffee and juice machines they should be spaced apart to avoid unnecessary queues during peak times,4/5
224, i didnt like anything we arrive at the hotel and they tell us that the room we booked is in the basement something not written in the description to have a room like normal people we had to pay  more which was unacceptablethere is no wifi in the room and it requires a fee the adapter or usb is not present in the room but must be bought for  and is certainly not something in favor of the customer the only nice thing was the view which couldnt be seen well from the room as the windows were dirty,1/5
225, they dont clean the rooms something unacceptable in a  star hotel internet payment only free in the hall lots of self service personal neither fu nor fa dirty clothes in the hallways food in the hotel is expensive and not very good my friend had an allergy from the dust in the room  nights and they did not clean once although when we checked in they told us that they did it every  days you have to go get towels toilet paper the best thing is the location,2/5
226, the rooms were clean cleaned every day very nice and helpful staff i recommend this hotel ,5/5
227, i dont know if my standards are too high but the hotel was terrible for me when we arrived we were assigned a room without a window we then immediately got another one with a window  pounds extra per day but only the employees can openclose the windows and you had to ask several times for this to happen you have to pay  pounds per day for wifi in your room and you wont get very far with data volume because you dont have a network at least for us the furniture is very run down the beds are also very wobbly mine broke after we made the bed and we got a better room both rooms were dingy the bathrooms were not cleaned properly and the towels and bed linen had stains the breakfast is also very poor although there is the typical english breakfast but for the price you can actually expect that there are other less specific optionsthe advantage of this hotel however is the location which probably also increases the price the underground station is only a few minutes away and you can get to the center of london quite quickly,1/5
228, ive been to many hotels in londonit is in an excellent position it has both the jubilee and the elizabeth new metro line the first is  meters away the second  meters away the neighborhood is beautiful and comes alive in the evening with many clubsthere are windows in all rooms but they do not openthe rooms are very large and the bed is king size something like that in londonthe breakfast was very good and variedthe top staff,5/5
229, dont go thereold dirty hotel filthy carpet old bathrooms and certainly not four starwe had to use the same towels for five daysthey dont take out the trash even if you leave it outside the dooroutside the door in the next room there was a chicken bone on the floor which remained there for the duration of our stayi will never go there againabsolutely not  stars maybe not even the only decent thing was the locationterrible cuisine all the food frozen sitting at the table you could see the chef defrosting the pizzas etcindecentthey say wifi is free but in reality you have to pay for it in the roomi give  star because you cant give less,1/5
230, strategic location and beautiful view from the roomsthe service leaves a lot to be desired the wifi is paid separately and in the tower it often doesnt work there is no fridge bar the landline telephone doesnt work the carpet is dirty and old and smells of smoke and above all the rooms are not cleaned unless upon explicit requestthe cost is high and it is frequented by unpleasant people furthermore everything is old and you can hear everything in the corridor or outsidei think its the star hotel that cares most about its customers that i know if it had been a  or  star it probably would have been perfect or at least i would have overlooked some expectationslet me know if you change the way you manage the hotel and if so i will come back and maybe change the review,3/5
231, the rooms were very oldfashioned and unfortunately dirty there was no room service our duvet was torn and we found a dark curly hair i have straight blonde hair my partner has short hair we were persuaded to upgrade to a room with air conditioning of course we paid extra for it but the air conditioning in the new room didnt work in addition the tiles in the bathroom were broken and it was easy to cut yourself very dangerous overall simply an outrageous price for the nonexistent service and comfort the food at the buffet wasnt particularly good either i wouldnt come back nor recommend it,1/5
232, i spent a december weekend in london in this horrible hotel that claims to have  stars i couldnt even give it half i paid  euros for two nights with a room that was freezing to say the least and  degrees inside i slept with fleece and two sweaters i called the receptionist for an explanation and he replied telling me that unfortunately they dont work absurd it was better in the open air than in that room the dirt on the carpets in the bathroom in the hallway in short was everywhere i kindly ask for a wifi password to access the network the receptionists response is connecting to the wifi network requires a fee it costs  pounds i thank you and leave a real hotels wifi must be free and accessible to its customers the sockets are on the other side of the room glasses filthy from dirt medieval bathroom with ice water with discolored and ruined taps very slow draining smelly towels not changed from previous customers had to wipe my face in the morning with toilet paper during the day when i went out to visit the city and on my return the room was not made up i found it exactly as i left it i would have a list of horrible things i went through in just two nights but i hope they fail because as seen from other reviews they confirm my own version dont go there if you dont want to ruin your accommodation in such a beautiful city terrible experience  euros thrown in the bin what a shame,1/5
233, i came as part of the london carnival reservations were made by the organizers place purchased on bizouk the hotel does not live up to a  star rating the bedding is far from comfortable there were constant technical problems in our room i was extremely disappointed with this hotel the breakfast was average the teams were quite respectful i do not recommend this hotel for a long stay,2/5
234, no hot water in the bathroom the designated nonsmoking room smells of smoke since you cant open any windows and the air conditioning doesnt work well enough the scent stays in the room in addition  of the  elevators are broken therefore you have to wait  minutes for the elevator our room is on the th floor for two nights over  euros is definitely too expensive for this hotel unfortunately we have to stay here another night,1/5
235, it was impossible to contact a contact person at the hotel in advance neither by telephone nor by email my flight had been delayed and i arrived after the checkin deadline even though it was mentioned that reception was open all night but due to lack of confirmation i preferred not to come than to be on the street in the middle of the night and to lose all of my reserved nights,1/5
236, we are currently staying here and we are very disappointed i can only underline all the negative reviews that have already been written here the supposed air conditioning turns out to be a permanent heater it wasnt until the second day that we were told that there was no room service as a matter of course because no one does that anymore in these times we have to get new towels and soap from reception every day i feel like im in a bad youth hostel unfortunately the priceperformance ratio here is not right at allso its best not to book,1/5
237, nice view friendly staff room service on the phone and quiet rooms,5/5
238, there is no room cleaning we stayed for  nights  people were not allowed into the rooms for cleaning we asked for toilet paper but it was not provided no clean towels were given there is no wakeup call room phones do not work air conditioning does not workrestaurant staff are very rude and not solution oriented we wanted a knife but couldnt get it we asked for a drink during the meal and they said go get it from the bar,1/5
239, cautionthe hotel has deteriorated incrediblythe furniture is very wornbroken socketsswitches are loose the toilet doesnt flush well theres limescale everywhere in the bathroom and the beds are old and hardroom service and fresh towels only on requestdefinitely not  starsin germany it would be a maximum of a  star hoteland absolutely not worth the money,1/5
240, hello booked two nights for notting hill carnival i couldnt sleep both nights arriving at  pm at  pm as planned i showed up to get the room key she wasnt ready i had to wait until  pm to get a key arrival at the room disappointment old style and especially carpet everywhere as someone who is allergic and asthmatic i coughed continuously as soon as i set foot there i even had a panic attack and at reception they didnt offer me anything in the room broken window therefore still open although you cannot open the bedroom windows in principle i reported it to reception who made me believe that someone would come and fix the problem i saw a rat in the lobby true i was sick after breakfast elevators break down all the time if you want tranquility and a minimum of comfort go your way this hotel is worse than the haunted house doesnt deserve its  stars,1/5
241, the room smelled of hashish probably from the previous personwhen we complained about this someone came with room fragrance spray and sprayed the furniture with it and tilted the windowby the way the rooms were not cleaned and fresh towels are available downstairs at reception upon request breakfast is worse than canteen food probably everything from a can and warm little choice one type of cheese and two types of fruit coffee was like water only black in colorthe location of the hotel is very far from the sightsthe bathroom and toilet are very outdatedwell if you just want a roof over your head that should be enoughps we can only swap rooms if we take one of your windowshahaha open execution,1/5
242, terrible hotel the rooms are dirty and outdated there is no room cleaning service during your stay they gave us dirty towels which we had to ask for at reception every time paid wifi very cold room with thermostat at  degrees with blocked system,1/5
243, nothing to complain about the rooms are older but solidly maintained and clean likewise the bathroom without obvious defects the fact that there was no wifi in the rooms does not matter because today almost every traveler has unlimited data on their phone the breakfast is very good the location is absolutely famous,4/5
244, the place has a nice location but is a little dated policies need to be reviewed room cleaning cannot take place every three days and on request,4/5
245, we were satisfied with our stay in contrast to the other reviewsits true that it was cold in the room but the staff tried to do something about itthe rooms are not the most modern but if you like the older style it is perfectattention only for allergy sufferers there are older carpets everywhere and there are apparently fragrances everywhere,4/5
246, dont go there old dirty hotel filthy carpet old bathrooms and certainly not four starthey never gave us a room for three days saying it was due to anticovid rules we had to make our own bed and use the same towels for three days at the price of  euros per nightwhen we left we asked to call us a taxi any hotel does this and they showed us an old telephone from which we called without receiving an answeri will never go there again,1/5
247, room condition is goodbreakfast its deliciousbut it costs  pounds to use wifi  hours a dayhousekeeping is provided starting from  nightstheres a supermarket nearby so its not bad,3/5
248, it is really an old hotel with facilities available but it is really very limited poor climate control beds leave a lot to be desired and the facilities in the hotel are not what you are used to at homeit is located in a nice neighborhood and is therefore very positive,3/5
249, next time id rather sleep under a bridge than here rooms smell very strongly of certain substances furniture is worn out if you want to ventilate because of the smell you have to call staff who come after  hour and to close you then have to freeze for  hours because no one comes after  calls would definitely not recommend this hotel ,1/5
250, do not go to this hotel for any reason it is not worthy of being called a hotel in my room there was a rat that was hidden they dont do housekeeping they only clean the room at check out terrible service horrible rooms if you go beyond the first floors the internet doesnt work only for a fee seven pounds in the hall the usb charging sockets dont work its a shame its disgusting there are many much much better hotels in more accessible and comfortable areas please dont book,1/5
251, the only good thing about this hotel is the location and even this is not that good i probably saw more than  rats who were having a good life in this bad hotel the rooms are mediocre but im not surprised that the consierge doesnt want to save this pretty mediocre hotel from ruin the customer service didnt help me anymore i dont know if its the way the english speak but there was almost no effort put into the way the customers were greeted,1/5
252, they didnt clean it for a week or change the sheets or towels you had to go get them the glasses in the bathroom were plastic and the bathroom utensils did not cover all the people in the room furthermore the beds were the worst i have ever had in my life the springs stuck to me and we spent a week without resting the windows didnt close and you could hear the subway the door didnt close properly lets say from  to  a  because the treatment was not bad it depended on who you got,1/5
253, good close to the ferry to go to the citymin costs about  and you literally step straight out the door westminster big ben the ferris wheel the tower all get off in front of the door idealmetro is x more expensive,3/5
254, the hotel is classic furnished in style but its nice it is very well located it would improve with a little maintenance but the service leaves a lot to be desired they dont make the rooms they do not treat the guest well mediocre breakfast,3/5
255, its a great hotel service is good but we felt quite stuffy in the rooms it was very bad in the first room and we were promptly offered a new room fortunately we had less trouble with that you can hear the metro if your room is on the waterfront,3/5
256,  star hotel which to my taste would only have  in france the welcome is average and no effort on the part of the receptionist to speak french when we tell him that we dont understand much english the main part of the room is clean but you dont have to look too closely overall i still have good memories of this hotel and i will book again if my route takes me to london again,4/5
257, terrible cleaning very deteriorated furniture they gave me a room with a broken toilet and feces which shows that they do not clean the roomsplus there are mice and insects on the carpetfree wifi only in reception,1/5
258, distant and evasive concierge staff good breakfast we miss a little more cleaning of the windows carpets and the room was not cleaned for us we only stayed two nights affordable price in good area nice common areas but many people in july,3/5
259, the worst hotel i have ever visited a room without windows that looks like nothing the carpet is worn out and the bedding leaves something to be desired the reception is disastrous with a receptionist who is not at all professional who has the nerve to tell us that the room will not be cleaned the next day as is the case in most hotels incredible to think that this hotel could exist in the canary warf district which is still the second largest business district in london after the city in short never set foot in this dump which thinks its a star hotel but which doesnt deserve anyi gave one star because it is not possible to give zero,1/5
260, it is a hotel with a good location although it is far from the center there is a metro station  minutes awayregarding the rest it is an old and neglected hotel the smell of the carpets shows that they are not washed or vacuumed very often the furniture is old with many aesthetic details in my room the sink drain did not work they let me a dirty coffee cup the beds are small the cleanliness of the room is acceptablethe staff is indifferent the waiters in the cafe a little less the included breakfast very very basic,3/5
261, the old rooms with walls with holes the bathroom door was swollen and old very battered there is no hot water they do not make the beds or clean the room during the stay i dont recommend it at all the only thing that can be saved is breakfast but it is definitely not worth it dont stay at this hotel if you can take a better option its definitely not  stars,1/5
262, the hotel is in the canary wharf area it is well kept and quite clean plus the rooms arent tiny there would probably be a need to enrich the breakfast selection a little and to review the elevators because they are not particularly fast given the  floors of the building overall the structure has a decent qualityprice ratio,3/5
263, not a good hotel the rooms are very old it is clean but poorly maintained checkin at pm pm is absurd although i didnt have to wait,2/5
264, the hotel is not a  star i dont think it even reaches a  starwe stayed for  days in october  not a single day did they clean the room change the sheets towels or make the bed the bed was disastrous it was a double bed that was actually two  cm mattresses joined together and with springs that you felt on your back all night the hotel is old and compared to the surrounding hotels even older our window was attached to the frame by a screw they had made it came loose in the middle of the night and couldnt close it took them more than  minutes to fix it the room did not have a mini bar or refrigerator breakfast is horrible the coffee and juice were horrible the pastries were hard and in general very little variety the windows have not been cleaned for at least a year to top it off in  a hotel charges you for having wifi in the room is insane,1/5
265, the location is excellent but the rooms are like being inside a prison unfortunatelyit is very hot and i do not recommend it although its location is excellent and the hotel is very largethe location is excellent but unfortunately the rooms feel like being inside a prison its also very hot so i dont recommend it despite its great location and large size,3/5
266, after the pizzeria and bar close you can forget about service at the hotel because if you need an ice cube the hotel doesnt have one also the hotel does not offer adapters for common sockets in other countries so either use usb which in my case did not have one or buy an adapter other than that the suites are cozyafter the pizzeria and the bar closes you can forget about service at the hotel because if you need an ice cube the hotel doesnt have it also the hotel doesnt offer adapters for sockets common in other countries so either use the usb which in my case i didnt have or buy an adapter the suites are cozy,2/5
267, terrible dirty and overrated place the location is fine but if you dont want to get an infection or a flea bite then run away people are treated arrogantly and it seems like you have to beg them for a servicedaily cleaning is not included you must pay for it separatelysimply avoid this hostel that looks more like a roadside motel and there are much better ones than this one,1/5
268,  days and they never changed towels or made up the room why at  in the morning someone outside sets off a fire alarm we go down pajamas and slippers and listen no one is considering us then someone protests forcefully and then we are considered,2/5
269, it is a great hotel somewhat outdated for the current concept it needs a facelift in its favor it must be said that it is located just  metro stops from westminster on the gray line which is something to take into account when traveling breakfast is varied and very good the pier for the boat that also takes you to the center is also very close,4/5
270, the stay was horrible the shower head was leaking there was no brush for the toilet which is very unpleasant when there are two of us using the toilet and in  days the room service has not come once in our rooms to clean our towels were not changed once the same goes for the trash can that hasnt been emptiedthe first time we went down to reception to ask for news they explained to us that the cleaning company had not come by we had seen a cleaning man in our hallway the same morningthe second evening we asked again for towels which this time we were distributed directlythe wallpaper in the room was dilapidated torn and stained in some places the bed too hard and rigidwifi was paid  per day  parking also paid and breakfast at  for two for  days and there was no safe for our personal items,1/5
271, too expensive for what it is the rooms are underequipped and the metro passes next to the hotel we had asked to change rooms for one that was better isolated from noise on the day of the room change we were told that the change could not be made because our belongings which had not been grouped together as requested were not all wrapped in plasticthe breakfast buffet is of a high standard and the staff who take care of it are very pleasantfinally i would say that this hotel does a lot of precarious employment since each of the people from minorities that we encountered was affiliated with menial and often degrading tasks some of them explained to us that they had no other choice than to do this job and despite their experience they have never received a promotion,2/5
272, the hotel is in terribly bad condition the service is actually nonexistent and the information on the usual holiday portals is not true the hotel does not have a pool spa or gym if you love dirt and incompetent staff and nightly entertainment caused by fire alarms that dont work hotel international is the right place for you the tension is even increased because no one informs you whether the howling indicates an emergency or not next time ill sleep on the park bench instead of here,1/5
273, its no longer a star hotel they do not have room service very poor breakfast little diversity it is far from the center of london despite being an area well served by transport restaurants lots of options commerce many stores and shopping centers and services,3/5
274, this hotel is super bad old they dont clean it you have to pay for the internet in conclusion terrible,1/5
275, a terrible hotel except for the locationwhen you want cleaning   it is said that the first cleaning of the day is giventhere is no internet on the upper floors there is a  pound feeif you have to ask for even the slightest thing from the reception you have to wait for  minutes it seems like everyone is fed up with this place,1/5
276, the typical structure destined to disappear compared to air bnbit costs too much for what it has to offerbreakfast which seems plentiful but is terrible in the evening populated by not exactly recommendable peoplethe rooms are not bad but the furniture is old and the carpet worn and dusty,2/5
277, the hotel is very close to the underground the rooms are older but we had one with a view of the water plus point  the staff was friendly and was always able to answer our questions quickly the bar had delicious drinks and was very cozy the priceperformance ratio was ok the hotel wasnt cheap but at least acceptable considering the location,4/5
278, a little noise through the partitions but overall its okay its well placed,3/5
279, service cleanliness rooms and beds bathroomhygiene i was still so disgusted more than happy to never see this hotel again and that at  euros a night the hotel is designed and operated in such a way that there are only onetime visitorsunfortunately you cannot award negative points,1/5
280, worst business hotel ever you book a normal room when you arrive there you are asked whether you also want a window and if so whether you would like to pay an additional  pounds staff at reception very unfriendlyrooms are old and tired and have very bad beds even if you pay extra for a window and wifi doesnt work this is certainly not recommended for the business traveler although the reviews seemed good i would certainly not recommend this hotel for the business traveler,1/5
281, it is an old hotel well located there is no wifi in the room yes it is clean although they do not do daily cleaning breakfast is good and the subway is close by although if more than  people travel it is advisable to use uber,4/5
282, old and shabby room with completely undone carpet completely dirty windows you could barely see out of the window dirty towels on arrival completely dirty and not changed since the previous check out wifi only available in the hall  floors below and in the room only for  minutes free i cant find a single positive thing bad experience i absolutely dont recommend it,1/5
283, horrible terrible service smelly and moldy room terrible cafe restaurant rude staff there isnt even water to buy after  am no minibar no safe they dont clean the rooms terrible,1/5
284, this hotel is probably long past its best years everything was there from dirty and partially torn carpets in the corridors to loose installations in the bathroom to broken elevators a basic renovation urgently needs to be done here however the breakfast was really good,1/5
285, i would like to leave  starsthe catastrophic receptionplus a rat  was invited into our room we reported it to reception and he was obviously not surprised not the slightest excuse we had to insist for several minutes for him to change rooms to flee,1/5
286, i just liked the breakfast very old hotel only  working elevator no room service paid wifi in the room really a horror show,1/5
287, old hotel spacious but decidedly unclean double room with worn furnishings and worn and dirty wallpaper and carpet unkempt bathrooms there are no power outlets near the beds the carpet in the hotel is so old that i developed a mite allergy for the first time in my life not recommended,1/5
288, hotel room without cleaning service we are told that cleaning is done every  nights and that is the hotel policy without windows that open to ventilate the room in which it is  degrees and whose air conditioning does not work no room change without paying extratorn carpet lack of soap mold in the room trash bin in front of the hotel entrance the hotel deserves zero stars,1/5
289, hotel poorly maintained furniture in the room broken leaks in the ceiling of the room if you turn on the air conditioning they have not cleaned the room i left the room early and came back after dinner they have had all day the elevators only had one of three working imagine the queues,1/5
290, attention everyonejust dont bookbetter go to the park and sleep on the benchthis hotel simply will no longer exist in the next few yearsive been to many hotels hostels and hostels but ive never experienced anything like thisany further comment is unnecessary,1/5
291, excellent rooms not cramped cozy interior everything works delicious breakfast and despite the fact that the dishes are the same every day there are many of them and there is plenty to choose from so you dont get bored there is food delivery to your room very tasty steaks pasta etc the windows in the rooms do not open but this does not create any inconvenience since there is air conditioning suitable for work visits the rooms have a coffee table with armchairs and a writing table the only thing i didnt like was that these same windows were terribly dirty so much so that it was hard to see the street through them in addition now there is continuous construction everywhere at the shipyard but the view from above is still amazing great hotel,5/5
292, you cant open the windows and the air conditioning cant cool the rooms furniture is worn and the beds are bottom drawer not recommended please book somewhere else,1/5
293, dated hotel in need of renovation not close to public transport at least in this period when there is a lot of construction in the area old and unwelcoming rooms however clean some corridors and rooms have a musty smell as do the elevators which give the impression they could stop at any moment,2/5
294, we rented an apartment in london which later turned out to be horriblethis hotel saved us at the last minute for a very good price from having to stay in an area that was not goodthis hotel is located in canary wharf londons business area roll wall streetwe also ate at the hotel restaurant very goodhighly recommended,4/5
295, very old and dirty hotel you can tell that it was a very important hotel at the time but now it is old what surprised me was that the cleaning was terrible they dont clean the bathrooms they gave us a room with a dirty toilet  i had to ask them to move us or come up to clean they changed our room where the bathroom was not clean either the bathtub and tiles had soap residue in  days they changed the sheets and towels but did not clean the bathroom my understanding is that it is international but in bacteria ps they do not store suitcases to take into account if your flight is at night,2/5
296, i thought the hotel was beautiful with good and cheap food but it is located in a new neighborhood of the city that is very far from the city center and with the traffic jams it ends up being very out of the way the rooms look old with antique furniture but its not dirty or smelly there is a bathtub in the bathroom and it is spacious it has a swimming pool and several restaurants  stars for the location and decoration that needs updating,3/5
297, we liked the hotel very much the room was spacious and the cleaning was very goodthe breakfast compared to london prices was varied and of qualitywe were able to enjoy an offer qualityprice and distance to the center was ideal,5/5
298, the hotel is located in a great locationthe room for two was clean tidy eighth floor furniture and equipment are not luxury but we came here to sleep not to take photos  which was also helped by the air conditioning which has a simple setting and is not noisy but effective bathroom and toilet also clean we also paid extra for breakfast which was made in the form of a buffet food tastyi give five stars because i would like a little help with the hotel rating,5/5
299, i am not satisfied with renting a room in this hotel the windows on the th floor are large and beautiful but they havent been washed for about  years you can barely see anything through them a star hotel welcoming guests from all over the world and they dont have socket adapters in the rooms must buy at reception for  the elevator doesnt work or keeps getting stuck for me it is far from the fourstar standard,1/5
300, we stayed two nights and they didnt let us know that they werent coming to make our room the next dayroom and bathroom especially super oldconstant queues at reception so you could not request information or help at any timethe location is only good for those who go to work in the area because it is very far from the center,1/5
301, totally dilapidated hotel cleanliness leaves something to be desired out of  nights the room was only cleaned once we saw a mouse in the lobby,3/5
302, the bigger it is the better it isso this is a real moment of delight this hotel is a journey you are between a very kitsch s hotel in las vegas and a happening place in prague and all in a relaxed atmosphere enter the accuseda sign at the entrance states that you cannot fight with roommatesthe room is windowless yes you read correctly without window i didnt even know that it could exist so the smell of the room i let you imagine because for  years she has never had the chance to taste the outside air i pass the hole in the carpet because a serial killer must have left the iron still hot see photo the walls full of stains the sheets good i dont prefer to imagine the pranks the bedding good lets move on from the subject of lumbar i advise you to take your flip flops and dont go barefoot two nights for  euros and there we are indeed tintin,1/5
303, bad service they charge extra for elements that in other hotels are minimal and free wifi for  pounds extra in the room it is evident that they are trying to economize as much as they can for example by not putting more toilet paper in the bathroom we had to ask for itwe found plates with leftover food and empty bottles on the floor in front of the elevator every morning the elevator was not workingthe hotel is surrounded by buildings so the view from the rooms leaves a lot to be desired besides the noise of courseas a final detail the decoration of the hotel is horrible with statues of lions and dragons coexisting with roman statues and teardrop chandeliersoption only if you are traveling for a very short time,1/5
304, very old hotel in need of renovation the room was large but it was not possible to take a shower standing up the mattress was not at all comfortable the internet was paid there was no control over the people entering the hotel they never asked me for identification not even at checkin,2/5
305, it was so good hotel for mevery kind staffi had one person  paid  preis is not expensive i stayed alone but it was goodalthough it is far from heathrow airport i would definitely stay here again but isnt breakfast unique to london i dont know but i didnt think it was delicious,4/5
306, the  good bedding and no or little noise the  the reception makes no effort to adapt to your level of english dated hotel threadbare carpet furniture that is  years old toilet flushing when we arrived over  days the towels were not changed cups of tea are not exchanged or washed and  tea bag per personfor  days be careful nothing is free paid wifi breakfast extra,2/5
307, approximately  rooms and only one elevator out of  in operation for  floors  days without them making the bed cleaning and changing towels,3/5
308, disgusting hotel old furniture upholstery carpet there are three elevators and they move very slowly and from their operation it is clear that the mechanism is already oldthe rooms are super stuffy when i arrived in my room it was  degrees after i turned on the air conditioner in two hours the temperature dropped to no refrigerator no minibar super old phones no reception numberin general everything here is disgusting,1/5
309, the hotel is clean and my room was spacious the staff is pleasant the only problem the very late checkin because we were a group i imagine and without any flexibility despite our constraints specified well in advance,3/5
310, it was my worst hotel experience ever the rating of  on bookingcom should have warned me exactly as someone wrote here  they tried to push me into the maids room with no window when i answered the receptionist was surprised to say that all the rooms have windows and that he would show me one he played it great when we got to the room his jaw dropped as if he had just found out that they had such kumbals too so he changed my room but the first feeling was bad and unfortunately he signaled that the britannia was not a good hotel no one has cleaned the room in three whole days and the water from the bathroom is apparently draining somewhere under the floor,1/5
311, the room was greatwell servedroom service possible being french i found that there was not a wide choice for breakfastwifi is available at reception onlyon the site they say that there is access to the spa and the swimming pool for hotel guests but when you get there you have to pay additional feesotherwise great stay,4/5
312, the building is not new but well kept excellent view of the river large and clean rooms excellent english breakfast included which is not easy to find in london hotels and above all excellent buffet dinner for only  pounds per evening advised,4/5
313, cleaning only after checkout therefore without towels and shower gel after the first day temperature stuck at  hairdryer and kettle not working i think due to an electrical fault in the room sink clogged after the first use,2/5
314, very good,4/5
315, for the price i would have turned a blind eye to the rancid dilapidated furnishings as the location is great but on our last day there or tomorrow i woke up and the whole room was under water i thought i was dreaming the water came from the bathroom and i checked both the bathtub and the sink to see if we had overlooked anything overnight  but none when i described my problem to reception they made us wait then a craftsman came and immediately said that we would have to cover the costs as long as he didnt find anything defective and what happened everything is supposedly in perfect condition i asked the hotel manager who came out of his office behind the reception and claimed to have been in the room and pulled paper out of the sink which caused the empty sink to overflow and thus caused the damage i asked whether its been raining in hotel rooms here lately or how something like that is supposed to happen and we didnt even have any pulp in our possession or even use it because we have towels how can it be that the sink is empty and dry in the morning and the entire floor is flooded and does he seriously think were going to voluntarily clog the sink then leave the faucet running overnight because its fun just to become  pounds lighter or what strangely he didnt know the answer to these questionsthe staff was unmotivated and disinterested few ladies at the reception tried hard despite the hotels problemsnow  pounds are being deducted from our credit card to replace the carpet m  its a complete impudence to be ripped off like that,1/5
316, google maps indicate the route very poorly but it is easy to access thanks to the metro station nearby in terms of qualityprice ratio its not bad at all i highly recommend,4/5
317, old hotel free internet for  minutes only when in the room room without minibar low shower double room comes with two single beds pushed together air conditioning difficult to regulate the only reason it doesnt get a lower rating is because it is spacious and well located,3/5
318, priceperformance unacceptablebooked with expedia as  but disastrous with a little effort and renovation the hotel could certainly be saved but the current condition is a catastrophe the staff is nice and helpful but that doesnt make it clearroom service daily mold and yellow spots everywhere in the bathroom air conditioning does everything but what its supposed tocheeky charges like day if you want more than  minutes of wifi in your room and dont want to lounge around in the lobby with dozens of other people is neither contemporary nor appropriate but a pure ripoffcheckin from  pm so far so good but trying to pocket  for every hour of earlier checkin if you arrive earlier is hard to beati advise against eating in the stored pizzeriaand there are mice raging in the bar lobbythe location itself is good and quite quiet transport connections to the underoverground top mall and shopping opportunities within easy reach,1/5
319, the hotel is located close to the metro in a business modern district of london however it gives the impression that it has not been renovated for a long time and is tastelessly decorated  it seems to be in a colonial style but it smacks of tackiness the service was rather distant not to say rude poor breakfast for this hotel standard  no vegetables few meats and cheeses only toasted bread there is a fitness center but the equipment is old and damaged and the swimming pool is tiny so it is surprising that it is not included in the price the rooms are quite clean equipped with irons ironing boards and kettles to sum up conveniently located with good rooms but for this price a hotel with so many stars makes a rather unpleasant impression,3/5
320, honestly i suggest closing for renovation good location with metro nearby and easy to get to but the hotel is very old and worn anyway under these conditions i will not stay again,1/5
321, priceperformance was great the room was very clean and nicely decorated shower wasnt great and no toilet brush homemade food wasnt usable either i really dont have high standards,4/5
322, the rooms are very clean and very comfortable typical old british has its bar restaurant wellness center frankly i dont see much to say about the hotel maybe about the wifi which is only free for two periods of  minutes,5/5
323, i dont want to ramble on for long but the rooms are very disgusting clean is different,2/5
324, the reception very dry attention very unfriendly as if it was difficult for them to work and they have a policy of blocking the total amount on the card from the first day the room lacks a minibar the hair dryer does not work the mattress makes noise poor cleaning few amenities,1/5
325, the very well located hotel with good public transport connections at least for our destinations probably saw its best days many years ago renovation and modernization are foreign concepts to management toilets that dont even flush paper elevators that stop for no reason and an empty breakfast buffet with crumbly scrambled eggs oh yes you probably only get that kind of thing here are just a few of the points that advise against recommending the hotel the fact that the safe for valuables costs  may be justified by the effort of the staff who have to be present every time you access the safe for security reasons but the fact that you always get unfriendly receptionists every time you have to go to the safe is on everyone management case the last point that is not possible in a modern city like london is the slow internet which costs  per day for just one device so two devices cost  per day,1/5
326, good hotel with nice spacious rooms everything is a bit oldfashioned and here and there there are some things in need of a makeover there are a few nice restaurants in the hotel and there is also a cozy bar staff are very friendly the only downside is that there is little variety in the breakfast buffet,4/5
327, room without windows dirty and with a strong smell of tobacco at reception they told me that if i wanted another room i had to pay and all with very bad mannerspay  euros for  days the worst hotel i have ever been to,1/5
328, how would you write in your certificate of good conduct they tried hard for the four days we were there the air conditioning was broken in the entire hotel constant  degrees despite the window being open at night there was obviously big city noise no excuse and still full price otherwise it is an old hotel located in the financial district this means you have a full subway all day due to rush hour traffic i cant say anything about the food would rather book a different hotel next time its a  minute walk from the public transport to the hotel check in only from  pm and not possible before despite confirmation by email at  pm you need time see photo,2/5
329, the only good thing about the hotel is the location the food is horrible where they place tourists for breakfast is a galeron basically bread ham cheese and coffee and in addition to all the internet is paid thats how incredible the staff is very poorly behaved in short terrible option,2/5
330, we came for an offer the room was good for the price it didnt have many luxuries but it served the purposethe problem was that we had the noise of a hotel machine stuck in our ears we called reception and they said they would turn it off at  but that was not the case we called a second time and they said they didnt know why they hadnt turned it off yet they told us they would look at it and call us which didnt happen we called at  at night asking what was happening until they gave us another room the new room was fine for me with little noise but my girlfriend slept really badly since the bed was super badand there is a construction next door how good it was at night or else i wont even tell you about the noise during the day,2/5
331, objective summary rating considering  pounds per night in the prebrexit christmas period proximity to the metro service offered etc  stars personal summary rating considering the sink problem  stars but considering the plus of the restaurantbreakfast  stars  starsstory hotel with city or river views located near the financial arearegarding my stay i can say that the welcome despite the large number of people checking in was smooth and the staff very helpful i was able to change the room i had booked for a better one on the th floor for a few pounds difference per day the large room with a beautiful view old style with very worn but functional furniture the bathroom was large but had the only and important flaw the sink was semiblocked with backflow from the drain hole some imaginable atrocities hair etc but despite my report there was no intervention abundant english breakfast buffet of quality and variety  stars if possible rich and quality dinner at the restaurant with  pounds  stars if possible drinks separately but including water the excellent restaurant staff polite kind  stars if it were possible if it hadnt been for the sinkif you found this information useful i invite you to click on the like iconthank you,5/5
332, service not gooddelay in receptionwifi is not available except for an additional feeroom service does not clean dailydo not add tea coffee or sugar except after your direct request,1/5
333, very unpleasant staff the only thing they care about is making the customer pay before anything else impossible to get served at the bar without paying first even with the room number no loan of adapter you must buy one without receipt,1/5
334, lets start with the location it is in a business area of london quite expensive by the way it is cozy but at the same time cold because sometimes it feels like there is not as much care in the facilitiesa big problem is that wifi in the rooms is paid and the price is high if you want to connect you can only do so in the hotel lobbythere are several places inside for food and drinks but i dont recommend them because the service is not goodthe hotel serves varied breakfasts in buffet style,3/5
335, the counter manager was rude and rude,1/5
336, far from the center but with nearby transport options including the metro the hotel has a restaurant and bar one of which we tried and thought was great as well as other establishments nearby including a shopping centerreasonable breakfast for poor and old and not very comfortable roomstaff are generally attentive and polite,3/5
337, generally i do not recommend this hotel very long waiting time for checkin old destroyed hotel in need of renovation not cleaned e rooms even though i booked a room with a window i received a room without a window in the restaurant drinks with lice,1/5
338, well ok for the priceunfortunately the air conditioning in the room was broken in the summer or it is always so weak and the whole hotel urgently needs some modernization but the location is not bad you can sleep for one night and the breakfast is included and rich,3/5
339, very nice hotel not far from a super market and public transport but elevator inaccessible at one point unfortunately we used the stairs to the th floor,4/5
340, the room was very clean and pricequality is correct but the treatment received by sebasti√°n has made my stay excellent their customer service is exceptional and now i would do it again,5/5
341, its getting old but it still has somethingyes the hotel dates back to a time when carpets were a must in hallways and roomsbut actually we slept well and lived wellwe didnt test the restaurants because the corresponding opinions had already been expressed herehowever i didnt find the breakfast to be as bad as many people describe it herejust englishmy son thought it was great to be able to eat fries early in the morningall in all if you go to london again the hotel is still a choice for short stays,4/5
342, it is a very old hotel with many rooms the carpet in the hallways is the ugliest its old the rooms are very old although it is good,4/5
343, location the hotel can be reached on foot from canary wharf metro station in about  minutes via dlr station heron quays also in  minutesyou can easily get to the hotel from london city airport with the dlrhotel lobby makes a rather elegant impression and you dont have to wait long if at all at the reception the taxi could be preordered hotel  victoria coach station was  poundsroom it was clean and cleaned daily in general the room was clearly english style with carpet except in the bathroom it had a tv but no hairdryer or minibarwifi wifi was possible throughout the hotel even if it was very slow in the evening,3/5
344, good hotel with a good location on dogs island comfortable price for london with a bus stop in front of the hotel and the metro undergrown canary wharf  meters away but you can go on the bus comfortable rooms the only thing i could classify as average is that they only give you wifi for  minutes if you need more time you must pay for it,4/5
345, nice hotel excellent breakfast for those who love british breakfastfor croissant and cappuccino loversvery limitedto be reviewed and absolutely to be improved the dinner and the quality of the dishes are worth it even considering that we are in the united kingdom overall clean in a good location,4/5
346, one of the worst hotels in terms of services dont be fooled by the pictures views and location of the hotel the service is very bad dont be fooled by the cheap prices these rooms are like a prison,1/5
347, the hotel is verynice even if it is a little dated but very comfortable rooms and breakfast with a wide choice and a top location with the metro stop just a stones throw away,4/5
348, total disappointmentfalse advertising deplorable rooms filthy carpet and inflated prices  flee this hotelstay from  to be careful this hotel is a real scam the advertising is misleading on several points the state of the rooms is deplorable and the prices are scandalously inflatedswimming pool the presence of a swimming pool is mentioned which is false the staff confirmed to us that it has been unusable for  years this information must absolutely be removed from the descriptionsrooms the difference between the luxurious entrance and the condition of the rooms is striking its simply lamentablesizzling or flashing lights flushmounted chandeliermicroscopic and malfunctioning television cabinet door that only opens on one sidedeplorable bedding we had requested a double bed paying and we found ourselves with two uncomfortable single bed mattresses and box springscarpet dirty worn and of questionable tasteprice be wary of the prices displayed online the price announced at  per night increased to  when we arrived at reception a pure and simple scam dont rush and book online when you arrive to save you moneyin summary this hotel is to be avoided it deserves neither its  stars nor the prices chargedif you have the bad idea of wanting to stay there anyway make sure to book in advance as prices increase significantly upon arrivalpositive points you need at least convenient location the hotel is located  to  minutes walk from an underground station making it easy to access central londonplease remove the mention of the swimming pool from the descriptionsthought to considerably improve the condition of the rooms lighting television bedding carpetrespect customers and offer quality service worthy of the  stars advertisedi hope this review will help future travelers make an informed choice and avoid this tourist trap,2/5
349, excellent qualityprice ratio spotlessly clean rooms equipped with everything hairdryer ironing stop ironing board etc,5/5
350, well located the building has many possibilities but maintenance is lacking furniture scratched and without handles bathrooms with bad shower shame curtains,2/5
351, the hotel is not very good the towels are gray there is no way to turn off the ventilation which blows cold air over the bed,3/5
352, the surprise already happened at checkin the price of the room contrary to the best price indicated on booking was  pounds on weekends when booking we indicated that we would like a room on a higher floor this is how we get the room on the first floor but the view made up for it we can watch beautiful construction the construction noise did not bother me as the windows cannot be opened therefore the guest receives mechanical ventilation day and night the ventilation system is so loud that you run away from the room the staff also pays attention to this since the magnetic card key is only programmed for  days in contrast to the day room reservationbut the equipment of the room made up for everything it even had an ironing board which is very useful for holding your suitcase,1/5
353, in the internet photos it has a pool in reality it does not exist they offer wifi for only  minutes for a single device in the room and every little while you have to connect in the lobby,2/5
354, structure a little dated but excellent location and friendly staff well served by the metro,4/5
355, top notch hoteland air conditionedand excellent serviceand the great location,5/5
356, hotel a little dated but with all the services spacious rooms with carpet wardrobe and tv iron and dryer,3/5

358, well its not that bad if only the chandeliers were a little higher its not convenient for tall people ,4/5
359, very old hotel excellent location,3/5
