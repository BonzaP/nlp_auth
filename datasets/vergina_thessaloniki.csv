0,the staff are very kind and helpful whenever i talked with them or asked them questions for locationssuggestions for places to eat or see the hotel is right on the main road of the centre making transportation with the bus or metro instant there are 2 atm machines outside the hotel and on the opposite side also 3 coffee and general stuff stores outside with one being 24 hour open for whenever i needed anything the room might be slightly vintage but still very cozy with airconditioning overall i recommend it and will come again next time ,5/5
1,the hotel is in a good spot but the lifts are small and often crowded i had to carry my luggage up three floors because it eas a big line for the elevators which was challenging given my thoracic polydiscopathy ,5/5
2,please be careful before you even think of booking this hotel because your personal belongings are not safe in the hotelthe stuff and the reception is very arogant and unhelpful so if you forget something and you ask for it they tell you to check the garbage yourself they dont even clean the room they only throw things  i was they personally and i saw it and heard it with my own eyes and ears their arrogance and liesthey dont even care for the customersthe answer i got from the receptionist was that he doesnt care for my opinion or reviewbid red flagavoid these liears,1/5
3,i had a terrible experience at this hotel the room was dirty and smelled musty and the bathroom was in poor condition with mold in the corners the staff was unhelpful and rude and it took forever to get any service the noise from the street kept me up all night i would not recommend this place to anyone no praking they lied in booking about having prakingcomplete waste of money dont go in vergina hotel,1/5
4,kind staff great location close to the bus station and city center by foot rooms are a bit old and not maintained but comfortable bed air condition and fridge for the price is great,5/5
5,dirty room rude staff in the room we found grass growing out of the cabinet not to mention the fact that we found dirty womens underwear next to the bedside cabin when we arrived to the room another thing to mention is the smell that came from the room absolutely disgusting will not be staying here again,1/5
6,this time they got new wooden floor and tv sets i got free late check out and kettle on the reception noise from early morning workers are loud bad isolation walls and toilete damaged good breakfast but still like in pandemic not self service,3/5
7,prefect location amazing staff great breakfast good internet nice beds fine shower okay this a 3 star hotel some part old but maintained some painting could do god impressions but for sure a accommodation i will return to again ahh nice big rooms and balcony helps if your a smoker,5/5
8,the bathtub door was broken the toilet was clogged before our arrival and not just to our room and there was nothing done about that most importantly the rooms were not up to our expectations since the photos were taken in the better looking rooms also the breakfast wasnt that bad although simple but the coffee was straight up water with some chunks in it,1/5
9,hotel well located with restaurants and markets nearby close to local museum average hotel with a bit dated furnishings but generally clean if not too spacious some rooms have balconies that face alleyway and others that face the front towards the promenade the breakfast was also average and as expected,3/5
10,very worst hotel that we experienced from our first minute we already experienced the worst things we are family i have son that has a stroller the elevator is too small nobody come to help us every morning the room attendant knocking on the door and urgently open it without our permition we stayed for 5 nights and they cleaned only one time our room the main door cannot lock obviously you will not feel safe the toilet bowl is dirty the bathtub has moss and the exhaust fan is too dirty full of dust and cobweb about the breakfastwe went only once because were not comfortable and theres no much choices to eat my husband told to the receptionist our concern no bodygive action,1/5
11,pros very friendly staff located in a suitable walking distance to al major sightings ie ladadika white tower agios dimitrios church clean hotelneutral area of location is a bit dodgy out of dated decoration inside the room breakfast is controlled by hotel personel which creates uncomfort during servingnegative low pricevalue ratio very old elevators which seems unproperly maintained severe side moving and noise during operation check out hours uncomfortable 1100 am leaking water inside the bathroom very noisy room due to the traffic of the main avenue parking of the hotel costs 10 euros per day,3/5
12,its been years since i visit it but i can still taste its tasty breakfast ,4/5
13,good position big hotel majority of rooms has a balcon the wprsr wifi ever even ny night almost like you cannot count on itstill without cable or satelite tveven not digitaljust a few greek channels the food is pretty good including choice professional reception and other stafrooms look solide,3/5
14,huge hotel ptofessional receptionists if the room is free and you are a loyal guest you can get early check in and late check out the rooms are refreshed modern brealfast very good but not selfself service no safe box and kettle in the room but there is on the reception,3/5
15,the worst hotel that i have stayedthe noise unbearable as teenagers were staying at the whole floor and the room walls thin as paperi complained to the staff but they did nothing about itthe rooms are so 80s i wouldnt give even a single star for this hotelworst experience ever,1/5
16,room is coldwindows dont close well,1/5
17,a small hotel on the main drag through thessaloniki not in the centre but not too far to walk to get to the crowds on the plus sidestaff are friendlylocationcost  ,2/5
18,the hotel is located very close to the city center very convenient for business trips the personnel is very friendly and accommodating the rooms are decent and the price is fair great for a relaxing weekend in thessaloniki,5/5
19,we slept one night during our journey to athensthe hotel is on the main road just 10 minutes away by foot from the main squareclean rooms helpful stuff garage for car park but breakfast is not selfservice you first need to point you food and then stuff put it on the plate and give it to you it was a big queue,3/5
20,decent room and bathroom breakfast was ok the hotel is a 3star bed  breakfast venue it doesnt serve lunch and dinner the location is on a main avenue but its quite far from interesting sights and food facilities except for asian fast food at hand and higher ranking hotels across the street,4/5
21,i dont think this hotel deserves 3 stars breakfast is quite poor that includes their cofee and their orange juice the first night they did not make the room i do recommend to choose an alternative option if possible,3/5
22,my worst experience ever i could not rest all night from the noises when we did complain in person to guest relation at 6 oclock in the morning about it the answer was why didnt you say about it to change your room notice that we took their last room the night before with their request to payment in frontwe did pay for one day 71 euro only to get more tired that we came we paid extra 10 euro also as we needed the hotel parking from basement,1/5
23,it is a cheap hotel rooms are modest but they have all you need the hotel is in the center but you have to walk 15 minuters to aristotel square they dont clean the rooms while you stay but they are cheap and elevations are working,2/5
24,the location is great as it is in the heart of the town but thats about it the bathroom was extremely smal not very maintainedl and very old the bathrooms ventilation very loud there is no elevator from the parking to the lobby you cant only use the very narrow staircase which doesnt have railing so if you are carrying language its very dangerous the people are polite this does not make up for the state of the hotel additionally the elevators are tiny very old and need at least a fresh coat of paint the lobby is the only thing that seems clean and renovated my room was on the 7th floor but with no view and with a balcony so small and narrow that the only place to sit was the airconditionings outside unit the rooms also were said to have tvs but it was no bigger than 2427 inches and the quality awful i would never recommend this to an enemy let alone a friend all in all a very bad experience which i will never go through again,1/5
25,nice place cody rooms it is not new the place but it looks good breakfast although it has many things like eggs cake sausages and a lot more except omelette everything else taste like plastic i would prefer less options but more taste ,3/5
26,the price i paid for this hotel was higher than the things that this hotel offered to me also they offered very few choices for breakfast and i didnt like it at alli usually couldnt connect to wifi at all but even when it did it was very slow and i couldnt use it at all,3/5
27,yeah the wifi wasnt working when we went to the reception for this problem they said it was because of our telephones the bathroom wasnt new and it wasnt very good the location wasnt very good either also the sink was dripping not a pleasant experience unfortunately,2/5
28,a little bit old school hotel but 3 stars in that price is fair offer air condition works well and very silent during a night breakfast nothing special good location close the centre,4/5
29,the room was nice cozy and suitable for a short trip however the internet quality is poor and very difficult to watch a movie or work online probably should improve on that,3/5
30,one of the most disappointing hotels ever very expensive and the room was very old remembering the 80s the parking is very small crowded and costs 10 euros per day the only good thing was the breakfast that was the typical tasty greek food,2/5
31,hotel is on great place in city centerwe had room near main road and it was noisy over the nightrooms are clean and and service was perfectgreat choice for quick stop,5/5
32,we stayed here on may 1415 in room 402 its a room for 4 people but i was only with my wife when we entered the room we realised there is a door that leads to another apartment in that apartment you could hear clear conversations so 0 privacy but the worst came during the night in that room someone was snoring like a chainsaw and we couldnt fall asleep because of that when we asked the reception they tried calling the room but nobody picked up the phone so they shrugged and said oh wellwe paid 110 euros for this room,1/5
33,a descent clean hotel with reasonable prices near railway station the offered breakfast is very rich the hotel has been renovated and it has led tv the rooms are quite spacious a fair hotel,4/5
34,the personnel is really kind and helpful and the location is great right in the city centereverybody in the hotel is going out of their way to accommodate guests needs highly appreciatedhighly recommended recommended hotel for business travel or leisure,5/5
35,it has a central position has paid parking lot 10day my room was ok i was at the 7 floor big clean with large great balcony and a great view but the others from the group has many many complains about everything the room to small the bathroom the sheets i thing i was lucky then with my room i do not recomand the restaurant but for the included breakfast was ok everything it is pretty old honestly i will not force my luck and come back here so its a no for me,3/5
36,the rooms are dated with stains holes in the rugs etc the bathrooms are kinda small and the area is not the nicest in thessaloniki but if you arrive by train the location is cool also the wifi is not really working well jumping on and off all the time breakfast is big but there are not enough fruits and vegetables to select from and also no black  wholegrain  healthier bread options on the other hand the conference rooms are great if you are in thessaloniki for business bottom line  a lot could  should be improved,2/5
37,just a fp accomodation its in the city center a little old but clean rooms and the bathroom the breakfast was ok,4/5

41,my jacket got stolen here i asked for the footage to find out who stole it they said i will get the footage the day after the day after they said the cameras dont work it was my favorite jacket plus at that moment it was less than 10 degrees celsius in the city,1/5
42,the pillows were dirty that we had to put a blanket over it to sleep the stuff was creepy sitting in the hallway asking every person why they are out of their rooms and lastly the facilities are very old,1/5

140,central ,3/5
141, ive never written a bad review before but now i have to its a real shame that we had to spend a few days in this socalled hotelat the beginning of our stay we were greeted by frowning staff at the reception neither good morning nor goodbye they explain with their hands where the garage is and look at the phone while we try to ask them anything the rooms are full of dust cobwebs mold in every corner unventilated and terribly dirtyrestaurant and bar do not exist breakfast is served by frowning staff who roll their eyes and when asked if there is more salad or bread they just wave their hands they do not replenish the plateaus with food even in the biggest crowd total disorganization only the location is good but the small and narrow parking lot and the inaccessible access to it spoil any impression of this hotel it is only good for avoiding,1/5
142, the hotel has seen better days i traveled alone single room small but comfortable the furniture has signs of wear during use the bed is comfortable hard as i like it the pillow is too soft typical for hotels the bathroom is small but big enough to do everything it is intended for clean and tidy with a worn bathtub and door on the cabin the terrace is small and most of it is occupied by the air conditioner the view is not great there is another building across the street but because of its 7 floors you can see the sea and the busy port,4/5
143, the only positive thing about this hotel was the friendly staff the room was unacceptable in need of renovation the photos have nothing to do with reality the toilet was dirty the cistern ancient you were afraid to step on it because it made noise and the pipes rattled we could also hear the cisterns from the adjacent rooms due to the poor sound insulation the curtains and walls with stains and half the lights burned out at least put pictures that represent reality,1/5
144, the hotel preferred by tours can be crowdedthere are 3 elevators in total but they can only fit 2 people the lower floor your room is the more advantageous it is i stayed for 1 night in general it is an old hotel the beds were comfortable the room size was sufficient family room with 4 beds the air conditioner was old and not cleaned i think the breakfast was nice and varied but if you are going to stay for a long time look at alternative hotels it is ideal for 12 days wifi is slow constantly disconnects and insufficient,3/5
145, unfortunately my stay at your hotel turned out to be extremely disappointing the room was in a shabby state with obvious signs of noncleanliness such as hair and stains the bathroom was equally dirty while the windows did not close properly allowing the cold to seep into the room despite the fact that the heating was not working properly the absence of even a bottle of water in the room was something unheard of for mewhen i informed the manager about the problems i was having unfortunately my complaint was ignored with the promise that it would be resolved the next day due to lack of available roomsit is unacceptable for an accommodation to offer such services and charge a corresponding amounti would like to point out that mr kostas from the reception was the only one who listened to me attentively and with understanding his professional demeanor is a stark contrast to my overall experience,2/5
146, the hotel is close to the center 1520 minutes walking distance street side is very noisy windows dont close properly breakfast is sufficient price quality ratio is still high they charged 10 euros for parking for 24 hours but parking on the side street is 2 euros for 24 hours you have to pass in front of it to enter the hotel car park i recommend you to leave the car in another car parkthe rooms and cleanliness are good but the decor is old and the rooms dont have that cathil etc,3/5
147, we had a very pleasant stay at this hotel which exceeded our expectations its location is excellent within walking distance of important points of thessaloniki the staff were friendly and helpful with our every question making us feel really welcomealthough i had read some reviews that mentioned cleanliness and noise issues our experience was completely different the room was clean and neat while the soundproofing was sufficient to have a peaceful sleep the hotel facilities fully meet the standards of a threestar accommodation with all the amenities we needed for a comfortable staycompared to its price the hotel offers very good value for money and i would choose it again without hesitation it is ideal for those looking for a comfortable and economical option for their stay in thessaloniki overall i was very pleased and will definitely recommend it to friends and acquaintances,5/5
148, the location of the hotel is very good the hotel has students with the effect of making noise and you cant sleep the tv and the aircondition are not working my room is 402 and it is separated from the next door by an internal door and what you say can be heard breakfast is served and poor old hotel but relatively clean,2/5
149, we went for three days and all three were awful first of all the area is miserable the rooms were never cleaned once by a cleaner the security guards were rude and told us to shut up at breakfast we found a hair and when we went to tell them they just shook their heads at us and the breakfast was poor the elevators very old and we were flooded as water from the rain came up to our beds and when we informed the reception they never came plus the railings from the balcony are ready to fall on the seventh floor unacceptable hotel i do not recommend it,2/5
150, averagethere is hot water in the rooms it is clean but when you open the window you look at the wall or at another windowthe breakfast is not bad but there is no selfservice you have to ask the staff to add an egg or feta deli small cups for coffee or tea and glasses for water were offered it would be better if they had bigger ones so that the guests would not get up every hour to get more coffee or tea and create a crowd guests bring bottles and pour drinking water from the vending machine which is very ugly better provide bigger glasses,3/5
151, beautiful initially the place was disgusting to say the least cholera collages in the toilets the faucet was broken and the toilet was flooding the sink had scale and was clogged the tub rusty and dirty with hair the sheets also had hair on them sad its not worth anything i cry the money i gave,1/5
152, it depends on what you mean by downtown but the hotel is not in the city centerit is close to jorgos shop with leather jackets but not to the centerthe rooms are decent clean the internet in the rooms is weak or nonexistent the bathroom is old but clean as for the breakfast it is very bad greek hotels are known for their poor breakfast but this is the first time that you cant take what you want to eat yourself but you explain to the woman who works at breakfast whether you want one or two slices of bread an egg or a fried egg and how much you want she pours you cant even take flakes or a box of marmalade by yourself you have to ask her and she adds to you very uncomfortable especially for elderly people who do not know english and children who are confused,3/5
153, the hotel is very old we had problems with the room doors and the air conditioning almost did not cool parking is required but an additional fee of 10 eur per day is required elevators are very small and old bathroom toilet old and dirty the hotel was generally very neglected the beds and pillows were clean the only good thing was that i dont think i would choose it again,2/5
154, my name is dimitrios balaroutsos and i am a tourist bus driver from patras i stayed in vergina for one night during my stay i needed medical help for some minor problem all the staff were interested in helping me thank you in particular the receptionist mrs kiki for her help,5/5
155, shit soundproofing shit bathrooms smell of rust the floor creaks nice location the bars swing on the balcony,1/5
156, the vergina hotel in thessaloniki offers good value for money and is a solid choice for travelers looking for simple but tidy accommodation the rooms are simple but clean and functionalthe breakfast buffet stands out but in a strange way instead of usual selfservice the food is presented behind a glass panel and guests have to tell the staff what they want this unusual approach may seem inconvenient to some guests as it limits the flexibility and independence expected at a buffetdespite this quirky concept the hotel overall offers reasonable accommodation for the price although the breakfast experience can take some getting used to,4/5
157, close to aristotelous square and the port the breakfast was good the service was at the level the staff is polite the rooms are airconditioned and clean only the elevators are small for such a big hotel,5/5
158, shower and toilet were fine the size of the room was ideal when the weather is hot the corridors and the elevator get hot as hell they probably have no ventilation the location is very nice walking distance to everywhere the breakfast is very inadequate you dont buy it yourself the staff gives it to you but there is very little anyway,4/5
159, its a shame that thessaloniki has such hotels with old rooms very dirty stingy breakfasts and asking 75 a night for a double room,1/5
160, fairly clean hotel its definitely showing its age but the service at the front desk room service and the staff serving the free breakfast is worth mentioning above monastiriou between demokratia square and the train station with easy access to transport it is recommended for a quiet stay in thessaloniki,4/5
161, the hotel is in a bad conditiondirty pet hair everywhere the air conditioner in the room broke and when i asked to change the room they told me that this is not possibleof course i left the hotel in the middle of the night this hotel should be locked down,1/5
162, the rooms were very small and quite dirty but very kind staff with good service as well as its location,3/5
163, very small room and bathroom and the food very average although the stuff is good,1/5
164, the location of the hotel is ideal for walking around the citythe room and bathroom were cleanthe air conditioner worked and their breakfast was richthe only downside is the old elevators,5/5
165, unacceptable for a 3 star hotelit needs a complete renovation the breakfast average,1/5
166, untended and unkempt bed with worn mattress bathroom and radiator rusty curtain dirty walls unpainted it urgently needs renovation to be considered at least 2 stars even the lamp in the room was burnt out and not replaced while there were no batteries in the ac control and the hair dryer in the bathroom was never dusted breakfast mediocre served it has much better options in the area just as economically unfortunately i didnt have the right to choose because i visited it organized for just two nights,1/5
167, i admit that reading the reviews here i was wary finally everything is fine the room the breakfast etc ok its not 5 star but for a decent stay it was fine,5/5
168, the word honest we use is the right one for this hotel services and prices very good,5/5
169, the location of the hotel is not in a safe place there are chinese shops on the back street and there is an afghan market on the left i would not recommend it if you are a woman alone the room was clean but dont compare it to hotels in turkey in terms of quality and service even the elevator is very old and you feel like you will always stay in it there are too many groups coming and there are too many queues in the elevator you can suddenly find yourself going up 9 floors wifi is slow and sometimes even disconnects the view of the hotel is not nice,3/5
170, it was a hotel we chose for its location the positive aspect is that it has a parking lot as for the negatives the hotel is old and smells also although it was written that the breakfast we paid for ends at 1000 the door of the breakfast room was closed at 930 when we told the authorized friends no one was helpful including at the reception if you have breakfast at 930 if it ends you need to write the time accordingly as a result i would not recommend it and would not stay there again,1/5
171, starting with the positives the staff were kind and helpful while at the same time the breakfast was quite richhowever the rooms and especially the bathroom need immediate renovation and modernization,2/5
172, the rooms need renovation breakfast is the same every day but the price is in proportion to the quality,4/5
173, it had very kind staff and the rooms were clean and neat the area was not the best but it was close to several shops one negative was that it was a 30 minute walk from the white tower i would go again without a second thought a also if the hotel owners see this i want to say hi to the boss  he will definitely prefer you to go,5/5
174, the room for 2 people is nice in rooms for 3 people 2 normal separate beds and 1 small folding iron bed are provided for 4 people 2 separate rooms and 4 normal beds are provided the rooms were generally clean unfortunately you can hear whatever is happening in the other room same thing in the room above you the elevator is really a problem it fits a maximum of 2 people but unfortunately this is not the only problem my room was on the 8th floor you dont have any problems when you want to go to the 8th floor from the bottom floor but when you want to go down from the 8th floor the elevator never comes you have to go to the 7th floor and get off from there at least it was like that during my stay the bed was very comfortable the bathroom was also good our table was moving but thats okay the view from the 8th floor was good i think the breakfast was sufficient and nice the breakfast area is the same way i think you can find better hotels for this price,3/5
175, hotel close to the center very clean good food still served as during the pandemic clean rooms functional ac tv in the room fridge,5/5
176, 1st unfortunately the photos do not represent the rooms they are something different from what you see on the site with this disgrace that you see up close and the bonus up close is the bad smell of the rooms2nd the elevators are tragically extremely dangerous for the physical integrity of the customer3rd the only good thing i have to say is that the gentleman at the reception was relaxedand4th if i were asked how i would describe this hotel i would answerall that glitters is not gold unfortunately,1/5
177, its a bit old hotel the rooms are modern but the elevator is very small in the city center,3/5

182, i give three stars only because of the location in the city center the hotel was basically for one night only we were a group of several dozen people and there was no room without major or minor defects our room was relatively functional there was only no hot water in the sink there was a tv fridge and air conditioning towels and cups were packed in disposable plastic bags the bedding is clean we only stayed one night so no one made a problem of it,3/5

186, the hotel is located in the city center near a busy area new rooms good standard meals in the restaurant are good and plentiful waiters serve what the guest wants although monotonous the same dishes to choose from every day the advantage of the hotel is the attention to cleanliness daily highquality cleaning it would only be worth refreshing the ventilation grille in the bathroom,4/5
187, i arrived in thessaloniki in the morning k went to the hotel k asked if i could stay until noon k if the price would be less which logic says he told me that he will ask but i will have to pay the full amount for one day then i told him that if it is not possible i will stay to see the city i slept for 2 hours k when i woke up k asked for coffee they told me they dont take anything to the room k as for coffee i will have to go across the street when i went down to go to the job i wanted i told the lady at the reception desk that since my cell phone wasnt charged if my wife picks me up tell her ill be back and ill call her she will not leave she asked mehad she stayed for 3 hours i paid 55 euros without a receipt and she wanted to leave because thats what the employee told her in the morning to room on the 7th floor undescribed floor from 630 am to 600 pm on the same day they were flawed in my eyes for 55 euros which probably make it much easier than me thats why they say sins of parents teaching children from outside me kla from the plague go to see,2/5

286, large clean rooms beds for children exceptional and attentive staff in the room you could find 2 free 05l water bottles in the fridge morning meal rich swedish buffet very good pates with cheese yogurts i didnt serve the other meals i stayed only one nighttransit i recommend,5/5
287, a very good hotel not too close to the city center and shops the facilities are in good condition clean and the staff are willing the breakfast quite rich and the restaurant staff helpful ,4/5
288, the rooms are clean and comfortable good parking options an important corner near egnatiastraße where the important sights can be seen a cheapest price ,3/5
289, threeday stay in a fivebed room with bunk beds quite negative such as 1 air conditioner for 2 independent rooms as a result of which it becomes a single room by necessity  not very clean bathroom with a broken sink that fills with water halffinished toilet paper from the previous one unacceptable the bunk bed was unscrewed as a result of which the children at the reception and at breakfast are buzzing all night long and the location where you can easily walk to aristotelous in 15 minutes because you are in thessaloniki which is relaxed and beautiful,2/5
290, an ordinary city hotel cleaning is ok there is a strange smell in some rooms we stayed with ten families during a closed tour organization ,3/5
291, old hotel clean but in the 2 days i stayed they did not come to lay down and clean the room rickety ac curtains floor etc i will not go again,3/5
292, they are friendly and the place is well located and has all the basics but it is an old building and although the rooms are renovated everything looks very old,4/5
293, i didnt like the room very old furniture persistent smell of dampness being forced to sleep with the window open the cooler does not cool the towels were no longer white but gray showing they had not been washed old collapsed sanitary installations the only good thing was the bland swedish buffet style breakfast,2/5
294, the internet is a disaster and they are not trying to do anything about it the room is solid but the toilet itself is a disaster when the water is released the entire ceiling shakes and the water does not drain adequately cleanliness is also not a strong point staff disinterested the city itself is beautiful and the center is located near the same hotel,2/5
295, zero cleanliness we chose a below average family room at 90 euros a night real value 40 by forcea rude employee or owner was yelling at us on the phone that we were late to the agreed arrival time not knowing why we were late,1/5
296, inexpensive hotel good service clean good breakfast the area is really not very good but its not far from the center we checked in earlier for which we thank you very much friendly staff ,4/5
297, honest hotel offers budget accommodation breakfast very good extra it has been renovated for the most part and the rooms are fully airconditioned mainly for groups business trips and for a short stay due to a stopover or change of means of transport very good location at the entrance of the city near the station and ladadika  port extra underground parking narrow and not renovated with care it fits staff excellent owner runs it personally,5/5
298, reception and lounge pleasant staff nice and friendly the breakfast was rich but always and without exception the same rooms for families are not so appealing so i would recommend renovations anyone who is a little afraid of the lift will definitely not take it cabin is barely enough for two and looks like it was built during world war i have fun whoever is on the last floors it takes 15 to 20 minutes to walk to the center of aristotle square 1 to 15 hours to the old castle in ano poli and 25 to 30 minutes to the zejting cemetery of fallen soldiers,3/5
299, the best hotel i have come across very good hotel especially all the beautiful things the view etc the environment the clean rooms the floors are also good i dont have any bad reviews to give i am just happy for this ,5/5
300, the hotel is nice the location is convenient but it was sooooo cold in the room the air conditioner worked all night at 30 and it was still blowing very strongly from the window we slept in our clothes under two blankets,1/5
301, it is one of the very average hotels that you are forced to stay in for financial reasons or because of a business appointment lets start with the rooms which i have to say i was disgusted to sleep in because of the conditions prevailing in the hotel in general they are quite old and combined with a hasty renovation give the feeling that they will be torn down the bathroom constantly has a strong bad smell and despite the indication that it was disinfected i would hardly believe it i also think that the existing ventilation is insufficient in the mornings despite ambitious efforts i would rather eat styrofoam than what they call breakfast the elevators barely fit three people or one with luggage otherwise youll have to patiently walk up one of the seven floors finally despite this i must state that the staff was very helpful and welcoming in relation to the appearance of the hotel i would only suggest it as a last option for a stay in thessaloniki because it is relatively close to the center about 1015 minutes on foot,3/5
302, the room smelled bad probably from the bathroom drain we also often found various buzzes in the room without having the windows open the sheet on one bed was speckled with some sort of old stain the bathroom looked clean at first glance but we noticed dirt in several places like something like coffee on the pavement above the sink also the paper in the toilet was from the previous half finished mercy the breakfast is good and has a wide variety staff smilingi personally dont recommend it there are better and above all cleaner,1/5
303, the hotel is old and not renovated 90 euros is a lot for a room with a hall that has a bunk bed at the end at least parking should not be charged,1/5
304, a 3star hotel within walking distance of the center of thessaloniki 12 km from aristotelous square clean above all satisfactory rooms relatively large it is suitable for business trips or even for tourism as long as you just need a clean room and not to be closed in the hotel all the timebreakfast quite rich the services offered are good wifi freeand lets go the staff is very helpful and kind and will help you with anything you aska parking space although you wont have much difficulty finding it in front of the hotel closed parking is offered attention it is paid per day for those who want to be more securethe prices for what it offers are satisfactory,4/5
305, breakfast time was difficult a group of strangers and a school trip at the same time in the dining area the staff doesnt have time to serve except they didnt fit in the same space it is suggested to split the time depending on the departure schedule of each group the elevator tragic too small one adult one child  and a suitcase,3/5
306, although it is an advantageous hotel in terms of its location where you can reach the center in 10 minutes on foot it is a hotel that does not meet our expectations in terms of comfort and food the furniture is quite old the bed is very uncomfortable the carpets are dirty there are no channels you can watch on tv and i dont know if it was the temperature of the air there were an incredible amount of flies since there is no proper place to park the car they ask you to park it in the parking lot but they charge extra for the parking service thats why we had to park our car in the empty places we could find in china street the variety at breakfast was neither too much nor too little but there were not many good options that reflected our taste if i go to thessaloniki again i would not choose to stay in this hotelit is an advantageous hotel in a location that you can reach in 10 minutes walking distance to the center and it is a hotel that can not meet our expectation as comfort and food the furnishings are quite old the beds are very uncomfortable the duvets are dirty there is not a channel you can watch on tv they do not have a proper place to park the car so they ask you to put it in the parking but they charge extra for parking that is why we had to park our car in vacant places that we could find in the streets in the morning the breakfast was neither very nor little but there was not a very nice option to reflect our taste buds if i go to thessaloniki again i would rather stay at this hotel,3/5
307, terrible triathlon not even animals live in such a barn the carpets in the rooms never seemed to be changed the bathroom was old with mold all broken and all old the walls in the room were a stinky shade of yellow it smelled so awful of mold and piss together that you couldnt even stay one night it was tristhlon nothing to do with what the website shows it is impossible for such a hotel to operate in 2017 the air conditioning was old and you couldnt turn it on and because it was hot and smelly together you opened the window but there was such a noise from the main street that you couldnt sleep unbelievable,1/5
308, extremely friendly reception and restaurant staff impeccable management it has an underground garage which is extremely important in thessaloniki a few minutes from the center i recommend,5/5
309, the hotel in general was nice close to the station and close to the center everything went smoothly until 11 at night but then i realized that the sound insulation should be improved a little because in the next room there was a couple in a very wild mood and the festival ended at 1 night,2/5
310, lots of noise from the roadno soundproofing at allbelow average breakfast,1/5
311, bad hotel the pictures on the booking have nothing to do with the real situation i dont recommend it,1/5
312, unfortunately very inferior compared to its price normally one star does it justice as it deserves 15 the rooms can be described as dirty with old furniture that needs immediate renovation the internet with constant interruptions and the breakfast quite poor,1/5
313, i paid for a double room and it wasnt just a double room otherwise clean good morning covid care,4/5
314, a good hotel to spend a few days there are many 78 floors and the elevators are very slow and old the rooms have a retro decor,3/5
315, good hotel for the pricethe furniture is a bit outdatedsmall imperfectionsbut overall ok for one night,4/5
316, a very warm front desk presence greeted us and created a very positive image spotlessly clean very well located and nice comfortable room,4/5
317, in my case the bathroom is clean and wellequipped the room is fine the location could be better,4/5
318, it needs renovation the staff is very goodthe breakfast is really great and super enoughproblem in the park is too narrowthe area is very run down,3/5
319, it seems to me that there are rooms in the hotel that have been renovated and those that have not unfortunately i was in the latter,3/5
320, friendly and pleasant staff however the room deserves a good refreshment the breakfast was more than average,3/5
