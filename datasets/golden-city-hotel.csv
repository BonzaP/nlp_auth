0,an absolute surprise i didnt expect such an amazing room for the price the half board meals are out of this world so much food and varietythe staff is super nice and helpfularis and angela at the cafenicole at the th floor dining roommaria and dimitri at the front deskand so many others i cant nameif you are visiting athens then do yourself a favor and stay here you will be amazed,5/5
1,one of the most beautiful hotels we have ever seen in our lives in all our trips is this hotel in athens and the nice gentleman wearing glasses in the reception and mr manuel who works in the restaurant at breakfast really this place deserves  and not just five stars and we hope to return to it and we will tell all our colleagues in belgium about this place caesar nikolas,5/5
2,this is a really great hotel however the area it is in feels quite unsafe when you walk from the metro the area feels very dirty there are syringes on the floor and areas where there are groups of people injecting drugs and sleeping rough i visited here with my daughter and as two women we really didnt enjoy walking back to the hotel in the evenings its a real shame because the hotel itself is lovely very clean and the breakfast every morning is really good you can walk easily into the centre of athens in about  minutes,3/5
3,we got the room after they told us the apartment we booked at the near neighbourhood is not availableto be honest after we passed on that neighborhood on our way to the hotel we were glad since that street seems really sketchy and quite crappythe room itself in the hotel is pleasant vintage looking clean with great wifi and a small balconythe stuff were friendly and welcoming the only thing to improve is the vegan options in the breakfast buffet,4/5
4,the rooms are small but really comfortable air conditioning and smart tv i really liked the breakfast with plenty of options the view from the top floor is also really nice i recommend it to everyone the neighbourhood is a bit ugly if you have a car you need to look for a parking lot,5/5
5,terrible service  beware of the apartment scam this hotel also manages apartments and when we arrived at the reception to collect the keys for our apartment we were told that they had doublebooked it and the apartment was no longer available despite us booking for two nights instead they put us in a hotel room that was clearly meant for staff not guestsafter reading other reviews it seems this missing apartment keys scam has happened to several other people as well so beware if youre planning to book an apartment hereto make matters worse the receptionist was rude and acted annoyed as if the situation was somehow our fault instead of their mistakeits disgraceful i cant understand how this place is still in business on top of that its located in a very rundown area with junkies hanging around right outside the entrance i wont be returning here ever,1/5
6,given its prime location the golden city hotel is definitely worth booking  especially considering the prices and included breakfast we stayed here for seven nights and have only good things to say about the staff  the hotel ,4/5
7,booked a room for an appartment hotel but the hotel agreed on letting us stay at the hotel because of our baby and did all their best to give us the keys as soon as possible the reception is very professional and very kind restaurant and breakfast staff are also very kind and attentive to our needs i recommend this hotel with a  stars well deserved ,5/5
8,the only good thing about the hotel is friendly staff maybe also the dolmadaki we ate at breakfast the rooms were very tiny the bathroom is not proper while showering the water spreads all over the bathroom floor no slippers or flip flops wet floor no slippers no hygiene unfortunately the district in which the hotel exists is full of homeless people and junkies they gather towards evening we were afraid while returning to hotel in the evening streets were not safe no coffee table no table no chairs in the room or balcony no place to eat or drink sth in the room no table for women to put makeup stuff in the room,2/5
9,little close to a few bad neighborhoods but the place is nice and friendly the room was actually wery good but the bed was pretty hard and not to good after  nights off it but my back is still ok so i guess we goodbreakfast was hot and always good nice staff but the cleaning ladies are  so nice and friendly always happy to help,4/5
10,we traveled as a large group of  people and stayed at this hotel our stay was fine but we were very disappointed when important items from several different rooms accidentally left behind upon our checkout were not found despite four ,1/5
11,disgusting the room was horrible awful smell which cannot be removed the stink spreads also to a corridor and makes you feel nauseated it looks like guests smoked insidehorrible service is adding up to the general picture rude and unpleasant receptionist who doesnt perform professional duties specifically solving the appearing problems they said if you cant stay in room which was offered leavedangerous neighborhood drugs addicted alcoholics and homeless are all around the areanever ever again,1/5
12,the staff was really nice  also the room was clean but unfortunately the location is not very good because near the hotel is one street that is full of addicted and homeless people that shows you unbelievable moments but also the online taxi is very cheap so you can easily book a taxi from the door of your hotel but be careful to get it only online otherwise you have to pay a lot,3/5
13,other than our room being very small the rest was great they have a very nice restaurant and bar and the staff was great we enjoyed our stay very much,5/5
14,the hotel is in a less than wonderful area with people sleeping on the streets close by its in a handy location to metro and bus for exploring the sightsthe rooms are ok breakfast quite good but cold dont have the buffet dinner again cold and very limited choice staff were pleasant and helpful,3/5
15,worst customer service ever rude and condescending to tourists they also help facilitate an airbnb scam where even if you check in and pick up the keys they will cancel your reservation and give it to someone else and then refuse to give you your money back or speak to the owner of the scam to top it all off its in the worst drug infested neighbourhood in athens with human faeces and used syringes everywhere,1/5
16,do not stay here if you are a tourist it is in the worst part of athens with heroin users and homeless across the street and nearby blocks not safe to walk at night no nearby stores or restaurants either the ac in rooms dont work either,1/5
17,if i was able to give zero starstay away from this dangerous hotel the staff are so lazy and ignore your requeststhere was noise until  am and reception didnt come to tell them to stop it  it does not have even an electric kettle the shower had problem the air conditioner was not working properly the neighborhood is so dangerous so many drug addict around i ran away after one night,1/5
18,the hotel is about m from the metaxourgeio metro station the third stop from syntagma square station ,5/5
19,the room wasnt that spacious but it was clean and with air conditioning the breakfast was very rich and tasty but make sure to be on time because strangely enough for greeks they are cleaning the buffet on the dot of the hour they are supposed to complete the breakfast so if it says breakfast till am dont expect to arrive at am and find food or coffee the area is a bit dodgy as you can see drug users around even on the day but none bothered us,5/5
20,clean stay with reasonable prices breakfast is ok with good varietiesneighborhood was ok on main street ,4/5
21,the hotel was clean and beautiful reciption staff both lady and gentleman was amazing and helpful ,5/5
22,my trip to renew my residence card took a long time and there was no room in my hotel i had to change the hotel it was a clean hotel with very polite and helpful staff the breakfast was buffet it was good and acceptable ,4/5
23,the hotel is lovely and the breakfasts were great rooms were clean and nicely furnished breakfast is served in a top floor with rooftop access hotel was convienent to the metro but if there werent men in my group i wouldnt have walked it at night,4/5
24,the hotel is great for a budget holiday  let me explainall the facilities and amenities are clean  from the room bathroom to the bar downstairs and the breakfast area upstairs which also offers a rooftop view of the surrounding buildingsthere is nothing to complain about as it pertains to the hotel itselfit isnt luxurious but it is absolutely worth it especially if youre looking to have a short stay in the cityits a short walk away from the city centre and archeological cites in the surrounding areasthe security staff γιώργοςgeorgios was especially accommodating a special thank you to him for conversing with us being kind and advising us about the surrounding areahe greeted us every day we had nice chats  if you happen to run into him at the lobby of the hotel definitely approach him he bought us sweets from a corner store without us asking or anything such a kind gesture the next time we stay in athens well bring a gift in returnhes a good guy and means well his being there made the stay betterif youre looking to stay in athens to explore the various classical and historical sites  i recommend iti would suggest taking daytrips to visit other cities nearby  its well connected to surrounding citiesbe mindful of the subway it can be dangerous as the evening approaches into the nightthis brings me to my most important point  ομόνοια omonia the area that surrounds the hotelit is the worst neighbourhood in terms of safety in athenslocals will warn you about it you will notice that development in the area is stuntedthis is the case as a result of various historical and political reasons multiple train lines werent developed until the s an influx of migrants as a consequence of wwii political figures stealing funds meant for the citizens of the city and so onthe migrants themselves are not the issue dont be mistaken the crux of the problem lies with the circulation of drugs improper infrastructure for citizens and human trafficking whether for sex work or labourdo not walk around with your phone in your hand if you want to take pictures check your surroundings firstdont linger on the streets as the late evening progresses into the nightthis particular restriction devalues the experience you have to be careful on your way back to the hotel due to the nature of the neighbourhoodif youre travelling with kids this will mean that you have to be extra cautious for us it meant having to be back in the hotel before it got too dark which effectively cut our days short for example we couldnt sit at a cafe or restaurant too late into the evening as we knew wed have to walk through the neighbour that surrounds the hotelwe were advised several times to take care of our personal belongings personally i suggest keeping your handbag in front of you andor beneath your jacket,5/5
25,they have wonderful breakfast a lot variety and the service on the reception is fineand close to city center and clean roomsthey have a place for your luggage if you check out and put your luggage they for some time you can enjoye the cafe on the ground,5/5
26,the hotel is fine good bed good shower good service but the location its just above omonia square a notoriously bad neighborhood in athens it was my first visit in like  years and the opioid crisis hit the area hard saw a lot of users using and zombie like people lining the street shame because i do like the area,4/5
27,this hotel must be evaluated from two aspects the first is to evaluate the same hotel and it can be given  stars as it is clean the atmosphere is good and the breakfast is wonderful in addition to the appropriate price the only negative thing was that the room was very smallthe second comparison which unfortunately gives the hotel a lower rating is the location as it is filled with a lot of homeless people around the hotel and in front of it from all sides unfortunately and most of them use prohibited drugs and the area is very dangerous after eight oclock as they gather untill the morning,4/5
28,stayed for two nights but without luggage  airline lost itif it wasnt for the kind young lady on reception who went out of her way to assist when dealing with airline i dont think i would have received the bag back in time for my tripalso the roof top restaurant is a very good place to eat good value with wonderful viewsthank you for a pleasant stay,4/5
29,left a few things in the room i stayed called them to keep my stuff and they promised arrived to greece a year later and my stuff was gone they did not even apologize,1/5
30,the neighborhood is horrible and so dangerous so many addicted people were using drugs just a few meters down the hotel the front desk was not cooperative the room is small the shower was broken  the ac was not working properly and it was cold only one elevator for nearly  units the door cant be locked from inside,1/5
31,one of the worst areas in athenes drug users and used needles all over the floor and the whole area smells like piss,1/5
32,the receptionist maria is very rude she manages also others apartments while she is working and she doesnt care about clients the hotel is quite standard overpriced hotel but i dont recommend it at all because the neighbourhood is full of junkies not safe at all i saw more syringes in  days than the rest of my life,1/5
33,good choice of hoti for the city centre of athens clear roomsgood service mini barrestaurant from breakfast time till lunchtime and the prices begins from  euros per person per dayvery good pricesas i know for groups my only distance is that the place where is it  the nights the view that the visitors have is not so goodcause the drug dealers which are going around of course the hotel has security services inside and outside of the place aroundso the safety of yours is  guaranteed recommended,4/5
34,average midlevel hotel clean pleasant stuff close to the city center but the neighbourhood is not so great even its safe you will pass nearby a lot of junkies and homeless people,4/5
35,nice and clean hotel with breakfast included the rooms were clean every day and it was an working acthe location is awful even though is very central the hotel is surrounded by homeless people just living on the streetsbecause of them the streets are dirty and then smell is horriblei would come back anytime at the hotel but not in the same area,5/5
36,staff is very nice and rooms are decentbreakfast is basic coffee really bad qualityinstant coffeelocation is in a really bad area of athens strongly not recommend on the same street and streets around is full of homeless people and the atmosphere is terrifyingin the evening ive being looking of my shoulder all the time,1/5
37,the hotel rooms are clean but a bit small the breakfast is excellent tho it does not change it is the same every day the hotel staff are really helpful and friendly they speak english the only negative point is about the location it is close to omonia so it is always surrounded by dealers and ppl to avoid so it is not a safe feeling to walk outside the hotel the the horrible smell,4/5
38,above my expectationsservice was very good fast and helpful including the reception cleanliness and the people at the breakfastthe rooms were clean had everything we needed perfect for a business tripthe breakfast was also quite rich for  if im not wrong star hotelthe only reason im not giving it  stars is the location which although is very convenient to the centre of the city is quite doggynot recommended for families just because of the area otherwise the hotel is pretty legitimate,4/5
39,the hotel is really good and clean the breakfast is delicious the only problem is the neighborhood there are many graffities on the walls and a lot of junkies homeless people and trash in the surrounding streetssok a köcsög,4/5
40,i highly recommend this hotel with  reasons  very clean room very helpful services amazing breakfasti was a bit hesitant to book this hotel as many people worried about homeless and druggie people around the hotel sadley they are everywhere in athens however those people didnt approach me nor asked for money the slow speed of wifi might be the weakest point of this hotelboth my hubby and i thoroughly enjoyed staying at the golden city hotel we will stay again if we are in athens,5/5
41,the hotel is centrally located near metro station and not far from athens main attractionsthe staff is very friendly and helpfultasty cooked and continental breakfast breakfast with good selection of foodgood valuethere were few issues with the room the deco is dated and tired i could not find tv channels in englishthe bathroom had a few problems nowhere to put toiletries shower screen doesnt stop floor outside getting flooded the shower drain cover is not fitted properly and keeps coming off making it dangerous to put foot in the hole and finally shower head leaking sideways and shower head holder is broken not able to have both hands free when showering,3/5
42,its a very nice hotel for a very good price the staff is super friendly and helpful and the restaurant has a nice variety of food the only problem with the hotel is the area you have to be a bit careful walking to the main square omnia where you have the trains but overall we had a very nice stay,4/5
43,the hotel is located in center of the city but was very dirty and full of homeless so you must avoid by any chance walking on the nearby streets during night but the experience with the staff was the poorest l ever had in a hotel in our first day the host from the restaurant literally shouted on us to bring masks on he sends us out of the restaurant and keep on shouting on us in greek but however all the staff was rude and didnt care little about their guests i havent heard a minimum good morning during my stay there also when booked we were shown a room but actually our room was very small no bedside table for one person so my friend phone and personal belongings had to be kept on the floor the shower have a small glass and when youre showering the water splashing all over the bathroom floor also the room have no soundproofing its very noisy you barely can sleep the wifi connection was very weak we loved that the room was clean daily housekeeping was provided and the maids didnt take tip which was a bit odd even if you put money on the bed as a tip youll find them back on return,1/5
44,the location is very bad all homeless and drug ppl around hotels not safe at all the wifi is not working i asked the staff every day and they told me today we gonna fix it but unfortunately until i left the hotels the wifi didnt work  the worst thing was when they cleaned my room they left the balcony door open and the neighbor could jump into ur room easily  pay  euro more just be safe,1/5
45,i cannot sayuch as we were not supposed to stay there our room was not so good the staff are friendly and what i could see about the hotel and restaurant and bar it look good the breakfast was a nice spread i didnt walk around at all,3/5
46,the hotel is good the location is great i was hesistant before booking because of the homeless around but they never approached me or asked money just keep your own mind and never look to them they are everywhere in athens the breakfast was great and tasty in open buffet the only real problem for the hotel was the internet it really sucks and the single room is too small i asked to change the room the reception offered to change without extra chargethey have a lot of booklets for the city and free of charge breakfast starts at  or  and ends at  am sharpthe single room is a backside min walk to nearest metro station omonia and to bazar market which has good prices,5/5
47,terrible location rough neighbourhood stayed here for the end of our vacation and it was so disappointing  on the way from the port the cab driver told us this was a very bad neighbourhood and to not walk anywhere ,1/5
48,this hotel is holding keys for another apartment around the corner so i was required to come here for check incheck out of that place although this may not be directly their responsibility they should not be holding keys for an apartment if they can not uphold the other responsibilities that come with it when issues arise the person on reception was rude very blunt and just simply unhelpful if you are told to pick up keys for athens cosy apartment from this place i would avoid the whole place altogether complete scam and this hotel should not be involving themsleves in such a chaos its ruining their reputation and i will never ever be staying at either places,1/5
49,great staff and servicealthough i was extremely lucky and scored a very good last minute rate travelling alone sometimes has its perks i felt treated like a king the one thing they couldnt do for me was clear their bookings so i could stay a few more nights boy was i surprised to see the streets of athens bustling with people near the end of october no surprise that a great reasonably priced hotel like this was completely booked i will have to try and be more organised next time,5/5
50,the hotel is alright nothing luxurious but also not dirty or bad like others describedthe rooms get cleaned every day and towels and blankets and such are also fresh and cleanthe breakfast is ok nothing special but also not badthe only big shock for me and my partner was that the area the hotel is located is very dirty full of drug addicts and needles and other sketchy looking peoplebut thats for almost whole athenso to be fair thats not the hotels faultwe didnt got robbed or had any contact with the locals they seem to stay for themselvesunity station and bus station isnt far toooverall a  stars for me,3/5
51,a great hotel located a short walk from the metro so easy access to acropolis and other sights accommodating with luggage storage both before and after checkin breakfast buffet was excellent with options a plenty including soya milk for the vegan in the group staff where brilliant and made the stay exceptional,5/5
52,i was told by locals that this hotel is located in one of the most dangerous areas in greece from my experience it is true and there are junkies everywhere the staff was nice and breakfast was good but the bathroom was a disaster i wouldnt stay again due to the location alone,3/5
53,very bad customer serviceno one speaks englishvery rude staffmissed my smart watchshower wasnt workingflooring not being stablethe hotel is in a less than perfect areawith people sleeping on the ground floor close by its bad location very far to metro and bus stations i never recommend,1/5
54,the room was very clean with good facilities and a strong shower all the staff were very polite and helpful throughout our stay the continental breakfast was reasonablei have dropped one star for the location because a road directly opposite the hotel should be avoided it is not safe for tourists to walk down and we were followed briefly until i got us back into the main roadthe other star dropped is for the parking we were advised to park directly outside the hotel but in morning we found damage to our car as someone had attempted to force entry it is not a safe are to park instead park in a designated carpark,3/5
55,the property was clean and respected to social distancing policies also they were welcoming when we arrived really late in the night and accommodated our requests the breakfast was simple but tasty and had something for anyone the ac in the room was a bit slow however very useful during the heatwave in athenssadly the property is located in a very sketchy and quite dangerous neighborhood which made going out in the evening not possible especially for women its unsafe and makes one quite uncomfortable,3/5
56,its a nice hotel plus point is its very good for your budget because they have a very good breakfast which is included in booking on a very reasonable price i just dont like the area it has many homeless people around that area but they are not harmful and the hotel has public transport spot very close like metro and buss stops,3/5
57,i stayed  days in this hotel the staff has always been very kind to me the room and bathroom always clean even the good breakfast unfortunately the air conditioner in my room did not work and i was cold at night plus during the night water fell from the roof of the bathroom  i did not like the area where the hotel is located better not to go out in the evening unsafe and very dirty i give  stars for the nice staff and the good breakfast,2/5
58,not very friendly staff mediocre breakfast bad area the beds were very warm and nice and the heaters were okay shower was confusing as it was just a shower head in the bath bathroom otherwise very nice fridge smelt awful so we had to disinfect not an area for going out alone and lots of crime nice room although there was lots of smoking in the hallway,3/5
59,though the hotel itself is just  minutes walk to the center minutes to syntagma square the neighborhood itself is not pleasant there are too many homeless people bad smell and they could be quite noisy during the nightrooms and breakfast is very good,3/5
60,rooms are completely different from what is shown on their photos weve booked a nice room with balcony but in a result  extremely small room without a balcony and wiev on technical part of a building without a sun during the dayconstant noise during night timethere is no table in the room and no single chairstaff is nice and pleasant,1/5
61,had everything you would expect from a hotel fresh bedding fresh towels and lovely cleaning service close to all the tourist attractions plus the added bonus of offering to call taxis from the reception at your requestbreakfast is good especially if included hot food cereal and fruit to name but a fewrelatively good pricing for a beautiful and busy city,4/5
62,the hotel is located near the center of athens and the sightseeing attractions that we wanted to explore with an easy access of public transportation however the neighborhood around is super scary as there are lots of homeless people sometimes you could even smell some weird things going home before pm is highly recommendedthe room was super clean and the ac worked all the times which is really helpful during summer it would be better if the room could have more light as it was a bit dark in the eveningthe staffs unfortunately were not as nice as we expected some receptionists were not very attentive or helpful we asked if the storage room is safe for our luggage as it was full of other guests luggage inside as well and there was no tag name or whatever and the lady said you can leave your luggage here or take it with you if youre scared  a very unprofessional answer  stars are for the housekeeping lady who worked in our floor was super nice and friendly to us,3/5
63,love it hear great buffet breakfast toorooms very large compared to other hotelsrobe to hang your clothes a big bonusbathroom abit dangerous be careful fills with water no shower screen use towels on floor,5/5
64,friendly staff the best recipcionist the best breakfast,5/5
65,very nice hotel and very clean personal very polite the receptionists were nice and helpful with a matter that came up breakfast could be better as online it is mentioned as buffet an we got a plate with one slice of cheese and one slice of ham cut in  pieces  very little sausages tomato with cucumber and an omelet for guests the price is  euro you got coffee tea and cereals as well i would have loved to get more cheese and not being forced to eat one slice of bread with cheese tomatoes werent fresh as i had diarrhea,5/5
66,the rooms are amazing theres a lot of space the staff is very nice especially the waitress with brown curly hair she made us feel really welcome here and dont get me started on the food bottom line its worth it,5/5
67,very badi have found insects in my bathroomrooms look big in pictures however they are extremely small in person furniture is very old and the wall is cracked surroundings is very noisy i barely slept also if you are going with family i wouldnt recommend staying in that area as it is known to have high crime ratecustomer service isnt the best they werent rude but not nice either they are just normal something you would expect out of a cheap  start hoteldefinitely not a  star hotel as they implyid say one thing i enjoyed is their breakfast they have a lot of choices and in fact better than a  star hotel i have been in previouslyat the end its your decision to analyze the pros and cons to what suits you best,1/5
68,we had a pleasent overall stay here rooms were clean housekeeping staff were great and friendly rooms were cleaned daily breakfast was decent although i would have liked beans as an option the location isnt great because of so many junkies and rough sleepers its good for local halal restaurants of which there are manythe only complaint really is in respect of mike from the cafeteria on the ground floor he was not friendly at all and on both occasions made me wait a long time before taking my order whilst he tidied up his cafe he came accross moody and made me feel unwelcome hence the  star rating,3/5
69,the staff is great they are very polite but the hotel is nowhere near  stars the rooms are very small and they smell of mould also the furniture is old and the wood and the walls are clipped the bathroom is nice and there is quite a bit of space but there is no shower curtain so water gets everywhere also i found ants in the bathroom,1/5
70,they contribute to a scam propertya property called dima rooms wrote me to pick up the keys at this hotel i replied back that i will and i will arrive by pmwhen i arrived on th of september tuesday i have been told on a rude way there is no keys for me it happened when you dont pay to the ownerit was shocking what that guy said how he dares to say something like that in the middle of another customerof course i paid and showed him the booking confirmation with the receipt he said it is too late to call to the owner this hotel is fullnext to this hotel there is another oneit was so unprofessional and rude i checked about the hotel for curiosity and consider to report the another property and i just found out that others travellers experienced the same situation as i it seriously need to be reported and investigatedthey leave you stranded in the middle of the night in a very unsafe area the area in the hotel is in a really bad place with plenty of drug addictions around keys never are left and the first thing it is coming to that guy is you have no paid it happens when they dont leave the keys shame on the hotel and the staff they have,1/5
71,wonderful experience we got there really early and they let us check in anyways i fell asleep in the lobby and no one woke me up i have to say however that the showers have a very strange shape and the whole bathroom ends up wet when you shower the lifts are particularly slow besides this amazing service,5/5
72,very bad customer serviceno one speaks englishvery rude staffmissed my smart watchshowe wasnt workingflooring not being stablei never recommend,1/5
73,the hotel is ok clean friendly staff great breakfast my room was small and the bathroom even smaller the bathtub was terrible very small cannot fit a grown human i will not be going back again,2/5
74,it is close to the city center the breakfast is great with a breathtaking view of athens rooms are nice with working ac the staff are extremely helpful and humble to assist with anything well worth the price,5/5
75,i wasnt keen on the area but its really not that bad considering i booked here last minute the team here at golden city is absolutely awesome and so accommodating all the front desk staff were fantastic especially xenia and maria and in the bar nikoletta and yiannis marietta nikoletta aliai were the best housemaids ever maria at breakfast and dinner was so awesome also i will miss the great service and smiling faces keep up the fantastic service i will definitely stay here again thank you very much giorgos and team,5/5
76,stayed here for a last minute  night break had read the reviews prior to arriving and was a little concerned by what i read but here is my honest opinion after my stay hotel is super clean and covid safe hand sanitisation available as soon as you walk in masks a requirement hotel staff extremely friendly and helpful no issue to big or too small breakfast is nicesimple but good as part of covid procedures the cleaning staff do not enter your room to clean during your stay but anything you require is available by dialling  on your room phone and they bring it directly to your room and leave outside your door shop directly opposite the hotel for essentials if needed hotel has security staff working virtually round the clock to ensure safe facilities all these good points aside the only downside is the neighbour hood which unfortunately has a lot of undesirables the staff are quite happy to call taxis for you to various other district areas ie plaka which is beautiful i do not feel that the area is a reflection on the ability of the staff or hotel its just worth noting that the area is not safe to walk about in after dark although i do feel that the police presence is quite high which matches the need also reassuring i would return here with my partner but would not bring my children as i feel there is too much to see for young eyes,4/5
77,we liked the hotel the breakfast was really good the location was not the best but we didnt feel unsafe the only negative aspect is the internet which didnt work  of the time,4/5
78,it was really ok good price the region is very dirty with manny drug and alcoholic adicted so keep your eyes up and stay sharp especially in the evening besides that the rooms was very old but clean atleast the bathroom was way to small it was almost impossible to take a shower the breakfast was very good and all the staff very friendly this hotel is only for persons who want see the city and just need a place to sleep,3/5
79,ill begin by saying those who didnt appreciate the breakfast clearly came here expecting fine dining from a  star and didnt get what they wanted  they should try  or  then nowthe hotel is absolutely amazing first off the location at night is not too bad sure vagrants could be around but its not as many as some may say these types of folks are everywhere especially in a downtown metropolis such as athinaclose to two metro stations metaxourghio and omonia square within  minutes from the acropolis hop on and off bus at omonia great restaurants nearby and the rooms complete with mini balcony and air conditioning in case made my layover in athens awesome to say the least definitely recommend,5/5
80,lovely central hotel clean  comfortable a good base in this bustling city wonderful professional friendly helpful and knowledgeable staff from receptionists to servers  especially spiridoula  george in the lobby cafe  bar who were a fantastic credit to this hotel and so welcoming daily housekeeping and housekeepers were terrific also the fabulous varied and plentiful delicious buffet breakfasts served am in the rooftop restaurant were amazing and the staff here too were great a wonderful time here highly recommended thank you ,5/5
81,very nice staff with the best of intentions and an amazing balcony to but unfortunately the rooms are absolutely tiny none of the  doors  entrance bathroom and balcony door  could open more then half way cause they would hit the bed also a tiny slow elevator makes you use the stairs witch with c weather can be sweatynever the less clean and acceptable just a bit to expensive for what it is,3/5
82,good hotel and location hopufully there be some solution from officials about to make safe all areareception stuff works great always ready to help many many thanks to them,5/5
83,the worst probem from here wifi work in  from the time so badstaff  kindcleaning staff  very kindbreakfast  you can eat how much you want from their buffetbathroom  my shower isnt secured all around with glass so when i use him i clean the bathroom as well lol we have just  igienic paper roll in roomroom  shocket electricty arent near to the bed so i just moved my bed more near to them but they have really nice lingeries and soft blanketsarea nonenone all athens aparently are the same with homeless people who waxx themselves so its okay,3/5
84,you get what you pay for  hotel is clean and feels safe complimentary breakfast is very good but rooms are tiny and smell like they used to have smoking allowed beds are hard good location for walking to metro and archeological museum,3/5
85,worst experience we arrive late evening and are lied about the room and given a rollaway bed for family the room was booked several months in advance after sleepless night on requesting for the correct room was given false promise later when confronted the desk the guy screamed at us and after some pacifying gave the correct room in frustration every person we dealt with kept lying and pushing the problem even though they had rooms available not recommending this hotel to anybody,1/5
86,nice rooms and staff very good room keys but location is a bit rough do not go out at night,4/5
87,rooms are noisy if you get th floor due to access to roof top is open room size is a little bit tight no water pressure on the shower in the morning and this jumps between cold and hot common areas smell drainage probably temporary problem make sure you double check your reservation mine was confirmed but when i arrived they seemed to have forgotten and sent me to other hotel for the first night employees are friendly on the other hand,3/5
88,the room is clean and comfortable the staff were friendly the breakfast buffet was very generous and the view was great will choose this hotel again next time in athens,5/5
89,not the best location but service and staff were very good just in a very bad area the hotel is in to many homeless and junkies around,3/5
90,generally a good hotel lobby and downstairs bar are very nice and offer free wifi however the rooms are prety small and lets not mention the shower and beds are just next to the balcony window making it hard to open it and get out also wifi in the rooms is not free but charged  for an hour with no chance to break the hour into two parts even in the same day breakfast room is on the rooftop and again if you want a cappuccino or something extra that is not on the buffet youll have to pay extra generally ok but i expected better,3/5
91,friendly service from everyone yes the location has its problems but thats because it is near the city centre and its not the hotels fault i can only recommend it because you can always call a taxi at the reception if you are uncomfortable walking in the area at night,5/5
92,there is no internet and smart tv they is not fixing wifi we spoke with reception during  hours and they didnt help beside this the one elevator is not working and other one is small and busy,1/5

99,after being pickpocketted just before a few hours we were due to leave athens and needed an emergency accommodation golden city was the cheapest available option it is comfortable has breakfast included taxi driver warned us it was in an unsafe area so we were too scared to leave the hotel we also had a buffet option for  euro given our situation i think it was ok and met our needs,3/5

176,good hotel,3/5
177,good hotel,4/5
178, the facility is located in the omonia district near the national theater a great base for trips to any part of the city due to the proximity of the omonia metro station the hotel serves delicious buffet breakfasts from  am and on weekends and holidays from  am you can choose lunch or dinner for an additional fee of  euros delicious meals the hotel also offers laundry ironing and a wellness center according to the price list very pleasant and helpful staff right from the entrance to the reception the cleaning staff also deserves five stars as they change the bed linen and towels every day and make every effort to ensure that you are satisfied after returning from a day trip finally a small minus but not about the facility but about the surroundings due to the fact that the building is located in śródmieście when returning in the evening you may encounter people wandering around not encouraging the exchange of opinions however throughout our stay in this area no one ever caused any trouble it is carefully patrolled by the police and the athens municipal police and the people i mentioned above do not get in the way of tourists i recommend the facility,5/5
179, an excellent hotel at a very affordable price the rooms are neatcleaned every day breakfast and dinner are included in the price of accommodation the staff is very accommodating and you will get everything you are interested in from the excellent receptionist the hotel is located in a location from which it is possible to reach the acropolis in half an hours walk without a taxi servicenext to the hotel there is a museum of miniature greek sights which is another plus for the hotels locationi recommend it,5/5
180, stunning hotel wonderful reception  hours a day magnificent bar and breakfastbuffet staffwhat is interesting in a hotel is thereair conditioningcomfortable bathroom unfortunately without bidetbed and mattress that after a busy day will lull you to sleep in no timeinternational breakfast on the eighth floor excellent sweet  savory with tables on the terracesilentthe surrounding area however has pros and cons that a person must be able to weighpros  minutes walk from acropolis  minutes walk from lycabettus  minutes walk from the central market and the center from where all the tourist shopping streets depart  minutes from the national garden and the adjacent presidential palace where the guards change  hour from the airport by metro andor train paying a whopping  otherwise  for a taxicons i would like to point out that there are some cons to consider if you come from beautiful and quiet areas if you are already used to chaos and a bit of a ghetto you will feel at home toxic people on the streets at all hours they dont cause any nuisance other than visual my experience cat calling at all costs in greek even from nontoxic people always walk with someone dirt fortunately however the residents and workers clean the streets with water and detergent to make the sidewalks of a city in decay but which is slowly improving even if only briefly return to shinereview left to express your experience of  days spent in athens visiting a city with so much culture history and very alive as well as full of touristsi saw all the best known and least known places of interest like everywhere always avoid those things that appear on instagram they are just commercial places that offer poor services and cost too much for what they are worth,5/5
181, the location is the worst there is a street nearby with a lot of drug users hanging around the hotel the smell is terrible and the roads are dirtybe really careful please dont go out at nightthe hotel is compact and somewhat oldthe elevator is small so if a group of people comes it will take a long time to get on the elevatorthe good thing about the shower is the water pressure and hot water the cafe downstairs was relaxingeverything else is below average there is no kettle so you have to ask the front desk for hot water amenities are also minimal i wish there were tissues in the room,1/5
182, the room was very small and very poorly soundproofed you can hear everything that happens both outside and inside the hotel even the music inside the elevator from the bed the room was not very clean and neither were the towels the location is terrible it is in the worst neighborhood in athens,1/5
183, the hotel is ok even excellent for three stars friendly staff the elevator is ultra slow the breakfast on the th floor is wonderful close to the main locations on foot but the location is bad there are a lot of homeless people and drug addicts out there so choose for yourself between price and security not for small children,4/5
184, reservation via booking for  nights we only spent one and took another hotelfirst point the neighborhood and its surroundings are not at all safe especially when we have homeless people prostitutes and especially drug addicts we felt unsafesmall and poorly soundproofed room constant noise day  night tiny bathroom with street noise heard in the ventilation bedding of very poor quality extremely hard for the evening meal and breakfast even in the canteen we eat better with very little choice frozen and especially when it offers fish because it is viscous staff having forgotten their kindnessreally move on,1/5
185, priceperformance top room clean and pretty good unfortunately only very small a little tight for two large suitcases breakfast on the roof terrace was really nice with a view of the city only breakfast ends on time and no one is kind enough to let you know if you need or want anything else but otherwise its great staff really nice and friendly if it werent for the terrible location we would definitely come back regarding the location a few streets walk from omonia subway station just walking you immediately get scared of the amount of zombie junkies hanging around everywhere the streets there are also pretty dirty and its really uncomfortable to walk there in the eveningnevertheless we are grateful and for your price in combination with a taxi to the hotel door is a clear recommendation,4/5
186, i was here one day and it was perfect close to two train stations breakfast was amazing delicious buffet the only bad thing is that the neighborhood is a little sketchy i wouldnt leave there at night alone as a woman there are many people who live on the streets and surely have a drug problem very good hotel good internet,5/5
187, the staff are very friendly polite and attentive morning and evening meals are hearty but served lukewarm wifi is available with good speed,3/5
188, organized trip then hotel chosen by agencyvery dirty and run down area of the hotel people of dubious taste walking around at all hours of the day the hotel itself has acceptable rooms food of very poor quality,1/5
189, i couldnt sleep well the whole night after staying there the soundproofing was very poor there were drunk people knocking on our door at  am the cleaning staff knocked on the door at  am and we didnt check out until  oclock,1/5
190, the hotel is clean unfortunately very worn towels and sheets very small rooms and bathrooms only one elevator for the entire hotel so during rush hours it is necessary to go up and down the stairs the biggest problem is the area in which it is located many homeless people who use substances no matter what you go by syringes and needles on the sidewalks broken glass pipes the smell of substances lots of graffiti and abandoned premises,1/5
191, unacceptable hotel apart from the fact that the room smelled like a cesspool it had a burnt old blanket inside and when we left they asked us to pay for it the reception was rude and when we said to pay by card he raised the amount logically if you dont inform them that the blanket is burnt they will charge you,1/5
192, the bedding is great the fabulous bathroom no soundproofing the staff is in an unpleasant mood we are far from quality servicethe neighborhood is poorly located and is frequented by homeless people,3/5
193, good value for moneyit is a bit far from the historical siteit takes about  minutes by uber taxi from the airport,5/5
194, we were transferred to this hotel because the one booked supposedly had an air conditioning problem so not by choice but nothing special excellent breakfast at the top view of athens,5/5
195, well here the opinion is not clear both good and not so good as for the location yes its like the center and no matter how not you still have to walk through some bad streets to get there so that they dont scare you as everyone writes you need to walk along larger streets and then its not so scary the hotel itself is not bad the rooms with balconies are cleaned well there are no complaints they didnt provide shampoos and stuff like that when you checked in but it doesnt hurt figured it out the breakfast is good in the panoramic restaurant cool in principle i also liked this when choosing a hotel and of course the price it was acceptable whats also good which we didnt know about is that you can also order dinner for  euros  buffet you can eat your fill and dont have to go anywhere and look for where to have dinner just right after long walks now if it was two blocks closer to omonia square then it would be great,4/5
196, the hotel is relatively good clean well maintained the problem is the damn area concord dirty garbage drug addicts homeless probably the worst area in the whole of greece now you will tell me why should i go and ill answer you because youre a poor desperate man like me the breakfast buffet is basic eggs jams breads and coffees but base it on the keyword you will like  unlimited oh yes in conclusion if you are looking for something cheap not romantic a bit dangerous but clean this is the place for you,3/5
197, i do not recommend spending the night in the area because at night the area looks like a central station people inject freelyhowever the staff here are kind and caring and helpfuli sat here for coffee thanks to the excellent wifi,4/5
198, the hotel is located in the worst place in athensterrible reception terrible attention from the waitersthe room was acceptable not recommended,1/5
199, small simple and clean hotel decent staff apart from the evening waitress in the restaurant not very pleasant and the bartender who is great he is top notch hard bedding i personally dont like iton the other hand the hotel is located next to a cartier who fears a homeless drug addict too bad,4/5
200, the hotel is located in a neighborhood with many drug users on the streets hotel really needs renovation the rooms are smallthe double hotel room i lived in only had a chair and a double bed with one bedside table the stuff is old the sanitary facilities are not practical,2/5
201, yes great hotel frfr it was such an upgrade to our previous hotel the bathroom was ultra clean and the bed was lowkey so comfortable and the tv also worked and the food was also ultra tasty especially the potatoes were delicious,5/5
202, the room is quite satisfactory meeting the requirements it is reasonably comfortable but the room gets very hot during the day and the air conditioning turns off several times by itself the service is friendly and the breakfast is good with some variety we purchased our stay with dinner included so in terms of dinner it was a bit disappointing in the sense that despite being made up of starters main course drink and dessert it ends up failing because all the hot dishes are prepared in advance and are heated in the microwave when we are going to have dinner this can be clearly seen in the food despite this it was an excellent stay i just dont recommend including dinner in your stay,4/5
203, renting apartments by booking is highly discouraged  hour  minutes of waiting at the hotel reception to send us to a room that is smaller and  more expensive which smells of cigarettes or the wifi does not work to avoid,1/5
204, we had the chance to stay for  nights it is a very nice hotel the furniture and beds are very nice the bathroom has been renovated and is extremely modern but what i especially want to say is that the breakfast has a very rich menu everything is very diverse and delicious you can stay at this hotel just for the breakfast im sure you cant stay in a better hotel for these prices by the way it is also very close to metro and bus stops if we come to athens again golden city hotel will be our home again thanks so much for everything,5/5
205, the hotel is nice as expected from a  star hotelthe room i was in was very smallits location is relatively close to all places within walking distancebutits a shame that when you walk back to the hotel at night you walk through the streets of drug addicts and homeless people as well as a neighborhood of immigrants,4/5
206, tragic staff we booked a room as a family with three children on the day we were going to go they called us to confirm and we informed them that we will arrive late in the evening because we came down from veria we got there around  and were told by the two gentlemen who looked like pakistanis that the room had been given elsewhere and i found myself with three small children at midnight in athens looking for accommodation far from there,1/5
207, ill start by talking about the location the area is horrible not recommended at all but even less so if you go with children junkies everywhere and people up to no good second the firstclass facilities seem fine but when cockroaches start to appear in the rooms its not so funny anymore they changed my room and i kept finding it a disaster and if you want me to continue the buffet schedule is not understandable it tells you that they serve dinner from  to  and when you go up one day at  they are already cleaning up and another day at  people are still eating the food is terrible in terms of variety there is nothing at all  trays with four things and if you like it well and if not thats what it is i have an intolerance and they dont even have lactosefree milk i dont give it  stars because you cant and if you like climbing stairs here you will be fine because there is only one elevator for  floors and you never know when it will come,1/5
208, unfortunately the hotel is in the worst neighborhood in athens drug addicts shooting themselves at all hours of the day and generally unfriendly people on the street it is not advisable to walk back at night a shame because the hotel is good and very central you have to be careful not to step on the syringe on the floor,2/5
209, we stayed for a week during our stay in athens in this hotel at first glance the hotel is not bad the hall is nice and the staff at the reception were friendly and helpful our room was nice and well cleaned but only on the first day day after day only the superficial cleaning of the rooms was neglected the breakfast was satisfactory with both savory choices how sweet the breakfast staff were all kind apart from one middle aged employee who in my opinion was very rude in his attitude he was behind the counter all the time staring at what people were eating the exterior of the hotel leaves much to be desired in the morning and especially in the evening people of disreputable repute etc i do not recommend going out alone in the evening there was some work in progress so during peak hours it was a mess to use the lift as the stairs were closed and sometimes the wait was long to get down all small measures that should be improved the hotel is located near piazza omonia from there you can move very easily throughout the city by metro and bus for the rest we had a good time qualityprice is good,4/5
210, the poor area in which the hotel is located is more than covered by its fantastic staff in all respectsvalue for money single room on the rd floor no soundproofing the door had an empty half finger the view was amazing of the room on the outside  and from the roof garden to the concrete of athensi wonder about some people who write about amazing views i really dosuper full breakfast,3/5
211, the first hotel we stayed in when we came to athens actually we wanted an apartment and paid for it to the intermediary company since the apartment was not vacant they hosted us at the hotel even though the hotel was more expensive they did not ask for extra money this approach is enough for me to give full marks the rooms were a little small but it didnt bother me they serve breakfast on the top floor in the morning but be there on time otherwise they collect everything when the time is up there are many people living on the streets around this is not nice thanks,4/5
212, excellent central hotel  meters from the omonia metroclean excellent quality dinnerclean spacious rooms with safe fridge and very comfortable mattressesin the afternoon homeless and disadvantaged people ,4/5
213, the room smells strongly of cigarette smoke it feels like you are in a pub the faucet is not working the floor is no comment terrible location if you want to see little india then come here dirty drug addicts oriental music in the middle of the night the worst experience of my travels the only positive thing is the restaurant on the roof,2/5
214, around the hotel is a neglected area that part of the city does not appear to be pretty but once you enter the hotel lobby you realize that it is very beautiful inside the attention they gave me was great the room ,5/5
215, cozy and clean room sensational spectacular service i was already missing that kind of good education in service in the balkans the attendant john was extremely attentive and polite very good and diverse breakfast one of the best checkin and checkout of my vacation trips,5/5
216, at the beginning of march we spent  nights at the golden city hotelthe location is not ideal at all each time the taxi took us back to the hotel it was impossible to cross the road because there was too much traffic and no traffic lights a real disaster with three children,4/5
217, worse hotel the person in charge after a remark instead of coming to talk in person called her and she didnt care about the remark we made to hera simple apology does not solve the problem rude almost everyone from the staff,1/5
218, a hotel in the city center is an advantage but also a disadvantage because the city does not sleep and rooms on the other side can be noisy at night rooms equipped with necessary things it is important that there is air conditioning the dining room is located on the eighth floor which is a big advantage because it offers a beautiful view of the entire city of athens i recommend,4/5
219, they gave us our key before our checkin time but the room was so small there was no room to step when we put the suitcases to the reception we told him that we did not reserve this room and that there was not even a photo of such a room on the site and we demanded and insisted that he change it he made the change sullenly it was a bad start for uscleanliness bathroom was full of hair on the nd day our room was cleaner because a different lady did her job that daybreakfast plenty of variety beautiful view coffee is badenvironment close to the stations you can even walk in the plaka area but i dont think you should walk when you leave the hotel and go to the opposite street you will see  people preparing their devices on the sidewalks and using drugs if you try the other street you will cross paths with women manual workers it is not difficult to predict the night of a place that is like this during the day  but there are also famous chain hotels just ahead strange,3/5
220, booked by phone  days in advance for  nights and upon arrival we were informed that one night is booked and there is no room available for a second night instead of business purely we ended up after  hours of searching in another hotel and it kind of spoiled our experience day,1/5
221, a bright oasis in a gray dreary neighborhood,5/5
222, even one star is too much we booked a room called athens cozy apart from booking they are a complete fraud we said we would be there at night they also confirmed the checkin and then they sent me a message saying that i could pick up the key from the golden city hotel at the end of the street i will add the message when i went to the mentioned hotel they stated that there was no such key and that they could not reach the room owners and without any help they said unfortunately we did not have a room and forced us to stay on the street we were left outside at  while dangerous people who could not stand on their feet because of drugs were walking around the streets it was an incredibly disgraceful experience the golden city hotel reception who contacted us seemed like they didnt even care and got on our nerves by saying unfortunately we dont have room unfortunately we dont have the key these people are people who do collusive business they know about each other but they are trying to defraud people by taking their money they do nothing but deceive people if you care about yourself at all stay away stay away from both of these companies those who do this be ashamed of your humanity,1/5
223, the hotel is in a very bad locationthe hotel is very good and the staff are very friendly,3/5
224, never again the hotel is located near  subway stations but you can only reach them via alleys that are full of homeless people drugs etc so we always took a taxi the path is not manageable with a childthere was no wifi in the room only a tv without a remote control it is old and worn despite superficial renovation the noise from the busy street in front of the hotel is not dampened by the old windows its always loud you can always hear your roommatecleaning is only done very superficiallythere are much better hotels in athens in the same price range so you cant even say its good value for money,1/5
225, service and rooms are okay  but there are a lot of drug addicts around the hotel and unfortunately very hard drugs  directly from our balcony you could see someone injecting themselves on the street in the eveningthere are certainly people who can ignore this for the low price but for us it was an unpleasant feeling just walking to the hotel from the metro the drug problem is clearly ignored by the authorities as dealers here are clearly selling heroin and crack on the streets from black backpacksunfortunately the breakfast is not that tasty with the exception of the rooms everything is more reminiscent of a hostel  some italian young people were here to party and unfortunately the rooms are very noisyon the positive side the staff was friendly,1/5
226, we arrived in a very charming bordering on luxurious hotel with a very friendly receptionist who showed us the room as well as the breakfast location breakfast which by the way was just incredible diverse and succulent you will find typically greek specialtiesas for the room it was really small but as you will see the bed was comfortableunfortunately the horrible neighborhood tox prostitute junkie live there without embarrassmentno way to go out in the evening unless you come back by taxi which unfortunately incurs additional costs i can tell you about an alternative hotel belonging to the same chain and offering the same prices the area there is also terrible  but its a stones throw from the metro so you get in quickly even if this area is really dangerous during the day you will not fear anything because the junkies are asleep,3/5
227, i just checked in and its much better than the hostel in synta magma square it makes me wish i had come here right from piraeus the front desk was also very helpful and it smells dangerous because there are homeless people but its not something that a former military veteran would worry about it seems like you pay a city fee of  euros per night but they also provide breakfast so it seems to be the best choice for solo travelers,5/5
228, dangerous area they broke into our car broke the window and stole our personal belongings,3/5
229, the location is terrible the worst area in athens its disgustingly located on the street it stinks very much and there are a lot of homeless people the room is all smoky you get the impression that you are in a cheap pub there is no insulation in the rooms a definite plus is the breakfast thats where all the pluses end,1/5
230, the service at the hotel is excellent the cleanliness is perfect cleaning is done daily bed linen and towels were changed every day the plumbing was new everything worked flawlessly ,8.1/10
231, the hotel had everything you need it is located in a quite interesting location on the acropolis maybe a minute walk about  minutes to the metro station varied breakfasts,5/5
232, the rooms are clean cleaned every day breakfast and dinner are delicious and quite solid for a  hotel the hotel parking is not part of the hotel it works  hours the price is eday if you take the car during the day otherwise it is e omonia metro station in nearby but around the hotel there are a lot of vagrants and drug addicts which are not pleasant to watch even if we didnt have any problems with themwe are satisfied with our stay in the hotel and with the staff,5/5
233, hellowe were pleased with the service and quality of the hotel however the breaking bad scenes in the intro and outro were a disaster the biggest fault is the operator company pronto tur he shouldnt adjust this placei mean the homeless and drug addicts around the hotel are very disturbing of course this is not a chaos created by the hotel however the public administration should produce a solution for the people there or mr is someone like fring feeding themnevermind keep well stay warm,4/5
234, poorly maintained hotel with many flaws cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired the room we had was very neglected ,1/5
235, hotel located in the northern area of athens the neighborhood is not the best in fact in some streets you can see drug dealing etc however it is not dangerous even due to the frequent passage of police the structure although dated is well placed very spacious and clean rooms the hotel which has eight floors offers buffet breakfast on the eighth floor overlooking the city the location although slightly out of the way is still very central in fact at about  meters there is one of the main omonia metro stations from which you can reach the acropolis in just  stops,4/5
236, a budget hotel thats how i would put it unfortunately nothing impressed me there but it didnt have to be because it was only an accommodation base  the only plus is the maids  the room was cleaned very carefully every day thank you ,3/5
237, the district is uninteresting nice hotel service express checkin and checkout tasty breakfast wide selection clean room unfortunately the windows were leaky which made it a bit cold in the room,4/5
238, we only spent one night the service the stay and the room were very good it is a  star hotel but it could perfectly have been  the biggest problem is that unfortunately the center of athens where this hotel is located like many others is full of people in the process of detoxification and it is easy to find people like that both day and night anywhere we always walked to the main areas and although it is true that nothing has ever happened to us the truth is that the contrast of seeing people in this state in front of hotels and luxurious stores is very impressive if you think this is an impediment taxis would be a good alternative for everything else an excellent hotel,4/5
239, first of all there are homeless people opposite the hotel and on the road to the center they are uncontrolled and dangerous sounds of fighting are heard until the morning you are stuck to the bathroom window in the toilet breakfast is not bad since we were going as a group they took us across the road accompanied by the police for safety one should stay closer to the center taxi drivers in the center ask for three times more money because there is traffic i do not recommend,1/5
240, the hotel is great they are friendly clean attentive and helpfulthe facilities are modern for the center of athens and for the price you paythe breakfast is delicious and the hotel restaurant is located on the top floor where the views and terrace are very pleasantnow despite being very well located at a strategic level in the city several streets in the surrounding area are frequented by drug addicts not one not two quite a few although in the center of athens you see many regardless of the location it is not a problem during the day since they are not presentat night it is something different on a visual level it can be a bit impressive for a couple without children or a group of friends it is a very good qualityprice optionwith children another area is better,4/5
241, you cant complain about the hotel itself the rooms are neat clean and modern with a flat screen the breakfast is good and you even have a nice view the beds could be a lot softer as a threebed room you get two beds and a folding bed with a few cushions which you cant sell as a real threebed roomthe bathroom is clean and modern but the shower doesnt have a curtain or anything so you get the whole floor wet when you showerbut the biggest and real problem is the location there are junkies and bums everywhere decision on the choice of words but thats how it is it stinks its dirty and no one should be walking around here alone after nightfall at the latesthowever if you stay in groups and always take the direct route towards the city center or something like thatits okay,2/5
242, there are no reviews from japanese peopleits a good hotel it was  yen for one night and two meals included the taste of the food is also goodwell its been said a lot that the surrounding environment is not good highly recommended for people who dont mind being in a bad place,5/5
243, me and my family  adults and a  year old child stayed  nights at the golden city hotel and it was a very pleasant experience clean and renovated rooms rich breakfast and warm atmosphere in general the girls at the front desk are stars they welcomed us with a smile and genuine interest and service george hotel security was kind and cheerful he helped us a lot with uber bags and anything else we needed during our stay thank you george you are a star,5/5
244, perfect for a night in the city we stayed with mp at this hotel due to unforeseen travel arrangements acceptable dinner and very good breakfast on the terrace ,4/5
245, the fairly central location clean and wellkept rooms daily linen change the abundant breakfast is served on a splendid terrace the only flaw is that the surrounding area is poorly frequented in the evening however the stay was wonderful as you can easily reach all the most beautiful places to visit optimal,5/5
246, very nice hotel located in the heart of athens on a very busy street but with soundproof rooms so we had a very good rest too bad the side streets are in disrepair and very dirty nonetheless very nice hotel impeccably clean spotlessly clean room with daily change of towels bed with super comfortable new mattresses and super soft sheets very friendly and helpful staff very rich breakfast with sweet and savory local specialities all to be consumed in the breakfast room on the eighth floor from which you can enjoy a wonderful view of the city they also serve lunch and dinner hotel very close to the subway which can take you everywhere the hotel has a bar and a large bright room where you can entertain yourself i definitely recommend it also very suitable for couples with children not to mention the truly modest cost i would definitely stay here again,5/5
247, the hotel as such in terms of facilities is quite good the rooms are correct clean and well equipped the breakfast is buffet and varied and the staff in general is quite friendlyspeaking of location it is important that you know where you are going to stay because the reality you are going to face is very sad it is completely full of street dwellers consuming drugs which is quite shocking they do not approach you as such but yes they are everywhere and if going during the day is not pleasant at night i am sure that more than one person would not do itits a shame because the hotel is not to blame but i think that if you are going to stay there at least know what you are going to find,3/5
248, hotel has a good structure but is in an area with drug users at night the perception is of a super dangerous place classic example of an establishment that was built in a location that does not favor its services it is close to metro stations and bus stops but if your interest is in seeing the tourist attractions and enjoying a peaceful walk around the city this is not even close to an appropriate place to stay after visiting i recommend looking for a more appropriate hotel to stay close to tourist attractions the prices are very close and the experience of staying in a room for fear of going out doesnt even make up for the difference in price compared to hotels close to the attractions i stayed at this hotel because i had put it in the search engine to be in the center but the center is not where things are located,2/5
249, i stayed at the hotel with my girlfriend for  nightsthe environment is ugly dirty and you have to take good care of yourself and your valuables the taxi driver told us when we arrived at the hotel there are a lot of shady characters drug use and trafficking for my next stay in athens i would look for a hotel in a better location apart from that there are many shopping opportunities in the immediate area and many of athens sights can be reached on foot in  minutes the nearest metro station is about six minutes awaythe hotel itself is beautifully and friendly designed the reception is open  and the staff is friendly you feel protected in the hotelour room met our needs it is nicely furnished and has a sufficient room size there is a balcony but the street in front of the hotel is busy the resulting bad air and noise quickly drive you back inside the windows are well insulated so when the balcony door is closed you can only hear the loud motorcyclesthe bathroom is basically nice too small unplastered areas detract from the overall impression when showering you have to be careful not to flood the floor of half the bathroombreakfast and dinner are available in the restaurant with a roof terrace on the top floorthe food is generally good and the selection is also ok due to the lack of food labels people with intolerances or vegetarians for example have a much more difficult timeunfortunately the restaurant was closed on two of our five evenings instead we had dinner at the hotel barthere was simply no communication with the staff in this regard we were not informed about this in advance and food was simply put on the table there was no menu there was just a meal consisting of salad mashed potatoes and beef my food was also coldso for vegetarians there is only mashed potatoes and salad this is definitely not the same as the buffet in a restaurant it is outrageous not to inform hotel guests not to offer a full vegetarian option and to charge full price for the makeshift offer,3/5
250, the three of us had more than enough space in the room the beds were comfortable and the breakfast was good there was a lot to choose from so there was something for everyonethe reception staff were very friendly and spoke very good english the room was cleanthe view at breakfast was fantasticthe hotel was quite central the price was really unbeatable,5/5
251, excellent clean hotel surprisingly in the middle of the dirty streets of athens there is parking nearbycomfortable large bed the room is clean no foreign odors i was pleased with the daily service and the shaped towelsbreakfast on the rooftop overlooking the acropolis was an unexpected bonus the breakfast is very varied its a pity there are no vegetables  only salad but the watermelons and melons pleased us with their sweetnesstwo elevators hour bar on the ground floor,5/5
252, it is located in a noisy area and offers a less than ideal menu ,2/5
253, value for money hotel in metaxourgeio and next to omonia the rooms are renovated and clean but small the space is sufficient for a nights sleep and basic needs the prices are reasonable and there is a standard buffet breakfast on the th floor with a nice view the hotel is very noisy because it is big and hosts groups and school trips people make a fuss during the common quiet hours without any remark being made by the hotel manager the area around the hotel is home to drug users and drunks in the evenings so be careful the metro stop is just a stones throw away suitable for a short visit to athens or a business trip for those who dont want to spend a lot of money,4/5
254, we were welcomed very well the staff is very kind and helpful we booked with the half board formula the restaurant offers really good dishes the rooms are very clean excellent hotel,5/5
255, the hotel is located in a very uninteresting area which as we found out is simply an immigrant district unfortunately im afraid to go back alone after dark the view from the window of homeless people  is really terrifying  so i dont recommend the hotel to families with children and especially women unfortunately you have to watch your step when approaching the hotel as it is very easy to encounter a syringe or simply used needles on your waythe hotel itself was very pleasant the service was nice and helpful the rooms were cleaned every day the hotel was generally neat and clean breakfasts are very monotonous without vegetables or fruit but perfect for a morning snack before trying local delicacies everything would be great if not for the terrible location,3/5
256, hotel in a very poor area quite luxurious hotel but shower and bathtub too small very good breakfast with a beautiful view of athens very secure with a card system to open the doors and turned on the power to the room correct set,3/5
257, the room was beautiful very spacious comfortable and impeccably clean the reception service is excellent breakfast is very goodwe went to several hotels in athens and this is the best without a doubtthe area is a bit dangerous but it is close to everything  to  minutes from everything most attractive and touristy in athens you just have to be careful at night nothing happened to us you must be attentivei recommend this hotel  stars definitely,5/5
258, cozy hotel very helpful and friendly staff great breakfast with a good view over the city of athens it is recommended to be careful when walking around at night otherwise the hotel is  stars,5/5
259, exemplary hospitalitythe staff cheerful helpful and professionalthe rooms are spotlessly clean amenities included hair dryer lighted touch mirror refrigerator locker wardrobe air conditioner huge tv and breakfast included in the rate on the th floor with a perfect viewthe breakfast had a huge variety of both savory and sweet all freshly cookedthe area is unfortunately strange and infamous for quite valid reasons and especially at night everyone has to be more carefuli want to dwell on the level of service i received during my stay at the hotel it was just all exemplary cleanliness service communication quality of service perfect value for money given that the amount i paid was in the range of ,4/5
260, the receptionists are very good the star goes to them everything else is terrible the location is horrible we had to ask one of the receptionists where to go and walk back from the acropolis area because the streets near the hotel are full of people taking drugs even during the day and many people who live and sleep in the area street all dirty the rooms are poorly distributed the bathrooms are poorly designed to bathe you wet the entire bathroom or even part of the room because the screens are small and poorly located the food is not bad but the service and those who serve at the buffet are terrible the attention is terrible only one girl speaks english and the others do not understand anything you say the one who speaks english treats you well one day and the next someone else treats you badly many contingents of children between  and  of approx she tells you that she opens at  that you can go at that time so you dont run out of food the truth is the customer service and respect because she made fun of me when i went to ask for a sauce that had run out and she told me that there was no more a misery,1/5
261, my girlfriend and i flew to athens for three days and came across the hotel because of the good reviews on booking ,1/5
262, very small room i could only leave my suitcase open on the bed,2/5
263, the hotel is already a little run down the beds are read but the rooms are clean the breakfast was ok but nothing morethe environment is terrible very dangerous according to all taxi drivers lots of homeless people and junkies,2/5
264, pleasant good place the staff was polite and very helpful the breakfast buffet is full of international standards,5/5
265, i made a reservation for  won per night and the room was spacious and clean breakfast is free and the quality is good the location is good because it is in the center of athens but the downside is that the area near the hotel is crowded with homeless people,5/5
266, i do not recommend this hotel for the following reasons very very small room if you open  suitcases you will have no space to walk around no exaggeration the room we stayed in was very dark and had a window but the view was not pleasant at all not to mention it was very noisy i felt almost depressed due to so much darkness at  degrees outside the hotel bad location despite appearing to be in a central part all the taxi drivers who dropped us off at the hotel told us to be very careful in that place and avoid walking on the side streets as it was a dangerous place one day i was returning to the hotel around pm and saw a man taking drugs on the main street there are many immigrants from iraq and pakistan according to a taxi driver very small bathroom with no shower stall its impossible to take a shower without wetting the entire bathroom its very uncomfortable not to mention the smell of sewage that came out of the sink when we turned on the tap cleaning i went to the beach for  day and the next day they came to clean the room they didnt clean the floor because there was sand everywhere and when they made the bed they didnt change the sheets and i think they put the blanket on the floor because the bed was full of sandmost of the people working there were very kind,2/5
267, well i didnt give it  stars because the location of this hotel is super bad in a very scary neighborhood with homeless people and drug addicts everywhere ,4/5
268, be prepared that the hotel is not located in the cleanest area it is not advisable to walk at night you will also hear street noise all night because there is no sound insulation a huge plus is breakfast on a high floor with a spacious terrace with a gorgeous view of the city,3/5

270, convenient location of the hotel near the omonia metro station  minutes on foot reasonable pricequality ratio ,4/5
271, not a bad hotel in a busy city center the rooms are clearly not new everything you need is in place the bathtub is very tiny it would be better if they made a regular stall there is a restaurant on the roof with a beautiful view it was nice to have breakfast there,4/5
272, we had a small room just opposite the elevator on the seventh floor which was just below the restaurant and breakfast room very bad neighborhood with drug addicts and all kinds ,3/5
273, perfect hotel all marble insidethe staff is kind and smilingthe rooms are excellent and spacious with a large bathroom and everything is spotlessly clean the breakfast is rich affordable price,5/5
274, the hotel is good good room clean the breakfast area is on the top floor with a spectacular view as for the location it is close to plaza omonia but on one side where it honestly doesnt feel safe to walk after arriving at the square the vibe of the place changes if you enter and leave by uber it is better if you plan to walk be very careful,4/5
275, it is a good midrange hotel rooms are not big but clean reception helpful small excellent hotel bar breakfast buffet excellent the main streets that surround the hotel from two sides are very busy ,3/5
276, the  nights we spent at the hotel golden city in may  were very pleasant the hotel cannot necessarily be held responsible for the noisy roommates ,3/5
277, it is located in an environment that does not favor it there are many suspiciouslooking homeless people and street people around itthey need to improve the service in the rooms they do not change the bath towels they do not supply soap or shampoohowever it has a good restaurant on the eighth floor where they prepare excellent greek food and the attention of the lady who serves and prepares in the afternoon is very pleasant and friendlythe hotel is in a good building,3/5
278, nice hotel friendly staff i was visiting athens on business and stayed for one night the hotel is very clean breakfast is not bad excellentwifi the area is certainly not one of the best but it is close to the center everything is nearby metro and buses are a minute walk away there are  metro stops to syntagma and  meters to omonia,4/5
279, as for the hotels service and cleanliness i have only good things to say the location is difficult though youre afraid to go out after dark otherwise everything is very beautiful rooms spotlessly clean good breakfast and the staff friendly and willing to serve you well done,4/5
280, good hotel both in terms of location and cleanliness clean room equipped with everything including a bathtub abundant breakfast in the morning and on the eighth floor with a view of the city of athens the very kind and helpful receptionist provided us with a lot of useful information for getting around the city the only thing is that the area around the hotel is a little run down,3/5
281, we went to athens in october with my mother and stayed at this hotel overall we liked the hotel the rooms are clean the food is tasty and varied especially for dinner ,4/5
282, excellent hotel welcoming and super friendly at the reception and internal barroom with air conditioning mini fridge available clean and welcomingbathroom a little dated but very clean and complete it floods easily when taking a showersuperstocked breakfast compliant with all covid precautionsexcellent value for moneyneighborhood not aesthetically beautiful but safe,5/5
283, very quiet cozy clean and good treatment from the staff ,5/5
284, the promised and described location was neither central nor nice the hotel was in a dangerous unacceptable criminal area that is by no means safe especially for young girls and families we were looking forward to central simple and affordable accommodation that offers everything you need however after our arrival we were completely disappointed and checked out immediately all taxi drivers we met before advised us to rebook immediately unfortunately not recommended at allthe staff was also not very understandingwe will definitely not book again,1/5
285, terrible location in the midst of pure decay standard rooms nothing special  floors of hotel abundant continental breakfast very helpful receptionists daily linen change location close to  meters so easily accessible overall without infamy or praise,3/5
286, reasonable location clean and normal breakfast the rest was very weak the room was tiny and barely large enough for the bed so to go to the balcony you only had to go to the side the bathroom without a shower ,3/5
287, my hair and all my friends hair became oily after coming here cleaning makes you vomit,2/5
288, my class and i stayed in the hotel for  nights the area is extremely degraded full of toxics and bad agents who bother tourists and girls dirty rooms blood stains on the towels nails on the hallway carpet and stains of male or female fluids on the sheets there was even someone who entered their room for the first time and found the toilet dirty small and cramped rooms even smaller bathroom with shower suitable for a  year old child by extension poor and not very fresh food needless to say the stay at this hotel proved terrible its appalling,1/5
289, while passing through the city of athens we booked for  nights a clean room with  double bed and  single beds breakfast taken on the roof top very pleasant staff choice and decent quality ,3/5
290, buffet breakfast with a huge variety excellent service room very neat and clean the main drawback is the area it is located very central point and close to a metro stop but every night you pass by drug addicts to get from the metro to the hotel in general the area has a lot of underworld you squeeze past them and hope they dont bother you on a main road so that means car noise plus screaming from the street all night downside also that it didnt have a desk to sit and write if you want something and the light inside the room was very dim and you couldnt read,4/5
291, i stayed two nights in this hotel with my boyfriend on the morning of departure in the rush i forgot my box with some of my earrings inside some of value others not ,1/5
292, despite being clean it has many drawbacks location in the old and ugly part of athens dominated by arab immigrants at night the location is dark and i do not recommend going out alone ,3/5
293, i wouldnt have booked the hotel but since my actual hotel missed the reservation they organized a room for me here the entrance area appears small and is fully occupied by guests ,2/5
294, for the price i got it was worth it there were a lot of junkies on the street but no one bothered us even late at night but there was discomfort the photos were deceptive in my opinion and a bit misleading however for the price in this area its good easy access even with a taxi as a starting point we are happy except that as i point out it is pathorevir,4/5
295, the room is good spacious not much to complain about in this regard except for a few minor defects such as leaking shower wall seals but nothing huge ,3/5
296, good hotel good value for money breakfast is varied dinners are varied very tasty greek dishes large portions the staff is very helpful my husband has a back problem and the mattress was too much for him they put a soft top mattress especially for us at no extra charge there are shops and restaurants nearby the only downside is that the neighborhood is dirty and there are a lot of homeless people,5/5
297, the location is not good at all very far from the tourist area unreliable environment the neighborhood does not seem to be one of the best in athens ,2/5
298, good facilities very clean and complies with the anticovid measures the staffs attention is very satisfactory we arrived before the scheduled time with the idea that they would store our suitcases to take advantage of the visit they told us that there was no problem at the timewe are organizing what we left and what we didnt they told us to wait  minutes and we could go directly to the rooms ill give it a hard time because the bathroom is not closed and all the water comes out when you shower and we had to turn down the faucet every night because when we came back it didnt work breakfast included abundant and good quality overall an excellent hotel totally recommended,4/5
299, beautiful hotel clean with an excellent view on the floor with a very good breakfast it suits me personally,4/5
300, the place itself is not bad but the neighborhood is terrible just to give you an idea my partner was afraid to go back to the hotel in the evening the breakfast included was varied and plentiful and with a beautiful view of athens they should spend a little on maintenance broken window in the bathroom that wouldnt close and wifi not working,3/5
301, starting with the positives a great view from the terrace in the dining room on the th floor very nice service clean and comfortablethe disadvantages of the area are unfortunately the sight of junkies and homeless people is rather the norm the area is very average for night walks on the side streets i dont think that the local bums and drug addicts are aggressive but the sight of them and the fact that they can collect money can be quite offputting the solution to this is the beat application which provides cheap taxis ,4/5
302, clean little room upon closer inspection with some agerelated wear small bathroom where you can sit on the toilet while showering very small balcony in the room street noise can still be heard clearly even with the windows closed but it is still possible to sleep at night because the traffic volume is no longer that greatthe rooms on other floors are currently being renovated good breakfast on the th floor with a view of the city you can eat on the balcony with a view,4/5
303, cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired used soaps in the bathroom chips on the balcony not to mention the service at breakfast rude waiters who answered you with a bad face ,1/5
304, the hotel is very good breakfast very complete they took care of our suitcases after we checked out and the staff is very attentive the area is terrible we were so afraid to walk that we took a taxi to get there and to go to the subway station full of people on the street people who had consumed its scary,3/5
305, it is a very good hotel with excellent service and good rooms for the priceregarding the area it is great in terms of public transportation to visit tourist areas of the city although somewhat degradedthe breakfast buffet varied and abundant,4/5
306, quite okay for one night the room is clean but very oldfashioned and the bathtubshower is moldy it also smells like a drain after a long time its a shame because i would have hoped for more for this price as a woman i would tend to avoid the area alone in the evening anyway as youre constantly being looked at strangely even when youre wearing nonrevealing clothing and sometimes there are quite strange characters walking around,3/5
307, the hotel is cozy the staff is friendly the breakfast is modest the room is not big the air conditioning is quiet the sitdown bath is very very small  meter and it is not possible to sit down and there is no room to stand either the area is terrible it stinks all around there are drug addicts fights and showdowns but we went there late nothing happened to us close to the center and the metro,4/5
308, the hotel is conveniently located and looks very nice inside and out true the two of us were given a room with a double bed but the room itself was good the bathroom is spacious the bed is comfortable ,4/5
309, nice hotel clean new furniture friendly staff excellent buffet breakfast served on a splendid panoramic terrace also suitable for disabled people they have both an entrance platform and a comfortable lift the area is central and well connected between two metro stops i definitely recommend it to anyone coming on holiday to athens,5/5
310, the hotel itself is very nice the rooms are great and cleanthe area is a bit spooky but that seems to be normal in the side streets of athens the location is very central and the sights are easy to reach since the hotel is right on the street it is a bit noisythe gentlemen at the reception are very friendly and authentic while the ladies dont even greet you when you speak to them degrading looks from the employees and stroppy answers as well as an unfriendly face seem to be commonplace among the women in my opinion thats not possible in a hotel regardless of whether its   or  stars we were also asked to eat faster at breakfast even though we hadnt finished yet ive worked in a hotel myself and out of respect and friendliness towards the guest you just wait until theyre finishedwe are generally satisfied with the hotel but perhaps the management should take a closer look at the ladies at the reception who are stealing from their guests and making the recession drastically worse,3/5
311, good hotel daily cleaning breakfast nice living room disadvantage one elevator although big and comfortable peak hours it has many stops and it takes time to get to your destination and the location is a little bit in terms of the people moving around but it is not so tragic,4/5
312, doesnt deserve more detestable area filled with drug addicts right in front of the hotel the cleaning done before our arrival more than doubtful dirty tea towel forgotten on the sink crumbs next to the bed see photosdirty room tiny and slippery bathtub very very noisy no soundproofingvery simple but plentiful breakfasti really advise against it run away,1/5
313, the hotel is surrounded by narrow dark streets full of aurolacs that make noise at night people are kind helpful friendly and attentive unfortunately the location and the rooms leave much to be desired i think the toilet lid was over  years old made of yellowed plastic it could be heard from the neighbours bathroom the air conditioner had a universal remote control that didnt work the tv worked but it reset once every  minutes i prefer lower brightness and return to default settings ,3/5
314, although the receptionist was extremely helpful i cannot make the same comment for the kitchen staff the kitchen staff are rude and noisy they are not helpful the breakfast is bad the neighborhood is not safe even though it is in the center there are many casinos nightclubs and noisy and dirty homeless people in the immediate vicinity there is no parking lot,1/5
315, the handicap room is tragic the wheelchair didnt fit in the room or the bathroom before i made a reservation i asked the person in charge to send me photos of the room and the bathroom the photos they sent me had nothing to do with reality i asked and they gave me another room which was a little more spacious than the disabled if possible but the bathroom was just as small my stay was very difficult and tiring i do not recommend it especially for pwds do not believe the information they will give you,1/5
316, my mother and i stayed at the hotel  weeks ago unexpectedly excellent hotel at an affordable price ,5/5
317, very welcoming staff good meal very good quality bedding on the other hand the busy street is very noisy and the bathroom is quite rudimentary shower and wc are side by side so its a foot bath every pee break star hotel which corresponds to a  or  star in france,2/5
318, no stars we had planned to stay there for  days but it was unbearable i didnt have much experience with the staff only with one woman and she was very rude while a man tried his best even though he couldnt speak english at the beginning we had a room that was very unhygienic the bathroom wasnt well equipped theres no need to start talking about the shower the beds were hard and without proper duvets after we complained and wanted a new hotel we were given a new room and we had to pay for that night otherwise we got our money back the rooms are old fashioned the area was very bad it was very bad to see addicts taking something in the middle of the street or sitting around drugged up everywhere in any case be careful i didnt feel well at all but to each their own the terrace on the other hand was very nice great view breakfast was also ok as standard since you cant give  stars this hotel unfortunately only gets a pity star not recommended,1/5
319, the location is not good at all very far from the tourist area unreliable environment the neighborhood does not seem to be one of the best in athens the room upon arrival was not bad except for the table that was sticky and the bathroom not very clean old room,2/5
320, positives very helpful staff rich breakfast with a view of the acropolis on the th floor negatives a little far from the center not in such a good area near metaxourgio you are afraid to walk old furniture in the room the sockets need fixing a lot of noise from the street and from the adjacent rooms that you can clearly hear each other the bathroom is dangerous since you cant stand in it there is a dent,3/5
321, we spent one night upon our arrival in the city of athensthe room was dirty the socket had the cable visible torn offdangerous bathtub quite small and slipperyi think there are better addresses in the capitalthe only positive point is the breakfast on the top floorbuffet style,2/5
322, the hotel is very good and nice the staff is very kind the room is very neat and clean the breakfast buffet is very rich we will definitely go again its location unfortunately brings down its image a lot,5/5
323, small quiet hotel very simple exterior the hall remains simple and well lit but quite old the receptionist with mustache glasses and more hair super super nice i recommend listens explains the places to visit very well and recommends a good little restaurantthe rest of the hotel remains simple too very nice elevator the room is more up to date with todays tastes with even decent comfort air conditioning safe bed but hard the water is hot straight away its top notch some shots are shaky housekeeping is done every day simple breakfast with a beautiful viewa little shinyin conclusion hotel that does the job price matches,3/5
324, negative points not very clean very small bathtub socket poorly fixed to the wall we asked for a double bed we got  single beds side by sidepositive pointsbreakfast on the th floor very good products quite varied,2/5
325, it smacks of organized fraud booked for  nights originally we were told that the room had a problem and we were transferred for the first evening to the hotel next door hotel vergina smelling of cold tobacco noisy and having damaged furniture  returning to the receptionist i asked for a partial reduction of the first night seeing the difference in quality of the hotels unfortunately apart from asking his manager for help he did nothingthe next day when we return to the hotel we follow up with them explaining that its their problem if they dont know how to manage the provision of a room but nothing helps finally the manager admitted to us that there was no technical problem and simply that they no longer had any rooms available due to flight cancellations due to covid and that the night next door had also cost them expensive than our reservation what to believe in the endin short apart from buying us a drink we received no compensation from themreading other reviews here i see that some have had the same problem hotel to absolutely avoid,1/5
326, the photos they put on the website are a deception i booked a double room for ten days and upon arrival we see that the door hinges are taken off the door has holes in it and the room left a lot to be desired compared to the photos we saw on the web when we complained about this they moved us to a much smaller room than the previous one in which we realized that the bathroom is very poorly organized super small and when it comes time to shower it has a small hole in the floor so that the water from the shower and sink comes out through there it is very unpleasant the smell of the pipes comes out there filling the entire bathroom and room with a bad smell and on top of that the bathroom floor is full of water as for breakfast buffet style little variety i could say that of the ten days i was there they made the room  times one of them they came in without us putting up the typical please make the room sign the other days they didnt come in and we were accumulating the same towels and sheets to the rest of the stay,1/5
327, of course the hotel bears no responsibility for the surrounding area,5/5
328, the hotel was very goodthe breakfast was wonderfulthe room was generally very clean the cleaners came every daynow as far as the area is concerned it was very scary and dangerousyou are very afraid when you come back after darkalso the door was broken and wouldnt lock,2/5
329, very accommodating during corona times when i had to cancel the first night due to quarantinenot exactly modern and not quiet either the room was on the street sideit takes around  to  minutes to walk to the sights the neighborhood is not that pleasant,4/5
330, we booked the hotel as an emergency solution because we had to spend another night in athensits only a threestar hotel but we were hoping for a little more for the pricebasically everything is clean but the hotel is getting a bit old all the silicone joints in our bathroom were moldy these could be replaced quickly and the whole thing would look a little tidier againin addition our room often smelled like sewagethe location of the hotel isnt exactly the best eitherespecially in the evening or at night dark figures roam the streets rubbish is scattered everywhere and there is an unpleasant smell of urine the hotel itself cant do anything about this but unfortunately its still unpleasant,3/5
331, convenient to the metro spacious room and standard breakfast on a beautiful terrace the neighborhood is very infamous the hygiene and maintenance of the hotel leave much to be desired,2/5
332, the hotel is classified as average the room was very small with little to no soundproofing and an air conditioner that despite being branded was underperforming ,3/5
333, decent appearance and rather star roomqualitative and quantitative breakfastpoorly soundproofed and therefore difficult nights neighborhood to avoid drug deal squat etc not recommended especially with children,1/5
334, i was assigned for a change of hotel i must say it was good i had half board and i was happy with the room which is not very large but the bathroom seemed to me to have been recently renovated ,4/5
335, breakfast on the roof terrace was okayunfortunately the rooms are unbearablenoisy musty former smoking rooms and very smallbut the noise from outside was also much too loudin addition the area where the hotel is is no longer safe after  pmthe smell and the figures scare you,2/5
336, this hotel meets your needs perfectly the bath is a bit small but the shower is fine due to covid breakfast is served for you and is different every day room is cleaned on request ,4/5
337, in a somewhat problematic area of athens near the omonia metro station the hotel promises more through its internet presence than it actually delivers ,3/5
338, the walls are thin the breakfast is ok but great staff not a bad location  minutes from the center,4/5
339, great hotel attentive and discreet staffperfect maidsgenerous breakfasts on the th floor with panoramic views of the city this is a great way to start a day visiting athens,5/5
340, very professional staff impeccable service cozy rooms excellent breakfast,5/5
341, the location of this hotel is the worst i went with my partner from the center to here and everything was dirty garbage and people on the floor we were really tense and uncomfortable ,1/5
342, the location of the hotel is quite inconvenient and dangerous especially at night we couldnt sleep because of the patrol cars passing by as it is near exarchia the cleanliness is incomplete the bathroom is small the carpet and furniture quite old some sockets were unsuitable for use and some lamps did not work one positive that could be included is the breakfast served on the top floor with a view,1/5
343, very clean hotel and the employees are very helpful breakfast is served in the roof garden and it is amazing the only downside is the location,4/5
344, although the hotel is very good i once again highlight the area currently omonia is not a good area we did not go out or arrive very late because we had respect for what was seen in those streets,4/5
345, the hotel is not soundproof so there is very loud street noise when the windows are closed the drains in the bathroom stank if youre looking for something cheap for one night yes but then you shouldnt have any demandsi will not visit this hotel again,1/5
346, i would call it suitable for a business trip the rooms are small but the insulation on the balcony doors is effective and makes the environment quiet ,3/5
347, i stayed for a week due to my companys training purpose the hotel nice clean with all amenities very good and helpful staff the food is very good and the evening buffet for  euros is well worth it ,3/5
348, very disappointing and certainly not a  star hotel the bath was dirty on arrival broken and dangerous sockets hanging from the wall lock systems that sometimes work and sometimes dont and very small nonluxury rooms that certainly do not deserve  stars,2/5
349, nice overall the breakfast is very good with relative variety the restaurant area with a beautiful view the wifi had some issues many times it disconnected or did not enter at all the area does the hotel a great disservice especially in the evening hours it would be better to go out by taxi or car it has a metro stop relatively close by karaiskaki square there is a private parking lot behind the hotel,4/5
350, location well served by public transport near the city center however the place is not very popular on foot in the evening,4/5
351, the staff is very kind the breakfast is above average excellent everything very clean,5/5
352, as soon as i left i dont recommend it because it is in a very bad area there is no parking and you would have to pay  euros a day for it then we asked for a cot for our little one they wrote to us in the email that we would have entered the room it was missing i went down to ask he told me he was sorry that he couldnt do anything at the time we arrived highly recommended,1/5
353, the owner probably has the impression that he owns the whole block,2/5
354, hotel located in the immediate vicinity of metaxurghio square in athensthe kindness of the staff clean heated and comfortable rooms make this hotel together with the closed panoramic terrace where an excellent international buffet breakfast is served a hotel where you can stay during your holidays or work in athensi would definitely recommend this property also because of the excellent value for money,5/5
355, i booked a triple room for family and they gave me a small room that does not correspond at all to the photos without any explanation or remuneration for the excess payment i made they scammed me and it seems from other reviews i read that they do it often their location is very dangerous for family this hotel is not worth it,1/5
356, the room size was good but the carpet looked like it hadnt been swept and the blankets were old at the reception the young man was helpful the breakfast was average overall it is an average hotel,2/5
357, clean quiet polite staff quite close to the center,5/5
