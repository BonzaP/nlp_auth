0,hotel complaintreceptionist   different receptionists were rude in different ways ,2/5
1,i stayed at the hotel candia with an educational tour group of  at the end of july during the hottest part of the summer the hotel has an amazing view of the acropolis and is fantastic at night  ,4/5
2,i hate to be so critical so lets start with the goodreception was nice i think her name is vasiliki no problems thereits about a  minute walk from the train station directly from the airportif you get an aceopolis view you can see it but its not a great view the rooftop area is better but its actuslly quite far awayconsi guess they allow smoking inside the rooms because my room smelled like cigarettes the second i got there the next day some people checked in and every m my room would get hit with the heavy smell of cigarettesthe bathrooms are tiny and the shower is awkward like its not a fixed shower head rather a detachable one that doesnt stay rigidthe walls are incredibly thin you can hear every car drive by and every conversation being hadthere is construction and they start early i was awakened around am by banging drills all kinds of noises and im fairly certain they were working in the room right next to or above mine so the planning of where to put a guest isnt very well thought outthe area is a bit seedy id recommend not walking around too late at nightthe airport conditioning is loud it creaks and pops all night and when the fan kicks in sounds like a motorcycle driving bylook if youre a smoker and a heavy sleeper then this place may not be so bad but im neither so i had a hard time getting rest here and overall i cannot recommend this hotel,1/5
3,nice hotel and great for the price rooms are adequate clean and with everything you need for a city break where this hotel sets it apart is the amazing roof top bar and pool area wonderful views to end a busy day of site seeing with a nice cold glass of wine ,4/5
4,stayed has it was booked by our tour company when i saw our room i was literally in tears it was like a room from the bates motel  painted wires bathroom from the s cracked sink ,3/5
5,dont be fooled by the photos this is a  star hotel with  star managementthe standard room with  beds and a balcony actually has  bed and no balconythe family room resembles a dormitory from a s orphanage with a balcony just big enough for a slender man to edge along sidewaysthe swimming pool is waist deep and feels crowded if  people are in it the hotel has well over  roomsthe front desk range from cheerily unhelpful to surly and unhelpfulthe staff are friendly the hotel is kept clean and the roof bar is a nice place to sit and relax,2/5
6,lovely little hotel the room was clean and modern all the staff were friendly and very helpful and all spoke english and the bar terrace was great with a little pool to use and great food to enjoy whilst doing so the views are great the area would probably put some people off but its actually very safe just alternative,4/5
7,nice hotel highlighted by an amazing rooftop bar and pool with a city view including the acropolis  manned by helpful and friendly bar staff the location is good enough whilst not central it is close to the efficient metro breakfast wasnt amazing however cannot think of any other negatives for the value of this hotel,4/5
8,the rooms were clean and sufficiently equipped the location is a bit far from the acropolis but it does have a great rooftop view of it and is just four stops away on the metro its a little farther from the airport about  minutes the rooftop pool is also nice though small and the surrounding deck gets super hot so wear your flip flops until you step in the food servers were fantastic but the front desk courtesy was hit or miss one of the gentlemen who worked it was super friendly and helpful and the other was very aloof,4/5
9,ive stayed in this hotel for a vacation with weroad the first day of our trip and the last day as we were  girls we were arranged in a triple room plus a folding bed for the fourth person ,2/5
10,stayed here for  nights in one room as a family of  honestly this hotel was nothing special  sounds harsh but in our opinion the photos are deceiving the rooftop and breakfast are the best parts so ill start there the rooftop has friendly and attentive staff when ordering fooddrinks and a beautiful view of the acropolis with ample seating and a small pool the included breakfast is the best we have ever had at a hotel tons of variety with sweets and fresh fruit breads eggs meat cheese greek yogurt specialty coffee etc the breakfast is the only reason i didnt give  the not so good part  if youre travelling with small kids who will want to splash and play in a pool  note that this pool is small and other people in the pool will be splashed the room was very cramped and lacked outlets no outlet in the washroom so many of us had to take turns charging our devices we also had  single beds which we didnt mind but they werent very comfy overall we agreed that this is a bare minimum hotel  but the breakfast and rooftop were nice as well as the location very close to the subway which was a plus,3/5
11,the rooms are not all of the same quality we had two and the last one needed some attentionthe location is not greatrooftop is pleasant it has a view of the acropolis unfortunately the pool is way too small,3/5
12,everything was great metro main train station and bus stops are just  min walking distance breakfast had many items though more vegan and vegetarian options could be included the rooftop pool was awesome all staffs are very friendly,5/5
13,no good reason to stay here front desk has a mean disposition rooms are frumpy ugly and dated from s maybe drapes dont even cover the window so you cant make the room totally dark ,2/5
14,staff are very friendly and helpful the hote isnt great its by the main road so the noise is non stop even during the night the room is dated and old the bath room needs to be upgraded the pictures are different than the reality its very close to metro station would i stay there again no,2/5
15,fantastic hotel with amazing rooftop bar view on acropolis and swimming pool personel is very friendly and helpful bathroom is not yet renovated therefore not the  stars they deserve,4/5
16,old smelly and small room stayed with a group and checked out and went to a better hotel had an included dinner with poor quality bland food the breakfast is like a game of hide and seek large groups of people so it was even harder to find food,2/5
17,staff super friendly rooms a good size could use a bit of updating but the ac worked well and the size was perfect for a couple  pool on the rooftop and rooftop terrace in general great not sure why some reviews said the area was sketchy  its not its just not the posh central area close to public transit though and a  uber away from plaka  would stay again,5/5
18,horrible old rooms beds and pillows are rock hardstaff were friendlyclose enough to the train stationonly good for the roof top view,1/5
19,nice hotel at a reasonable cost in a good part of athens very nice pool area very comfortable room with good ac and tv,5/5
20,overall a star hotel by scandinavian standards we were pleased with our spaceous newly renovated room but others in our travel party were not that fortunate ,3/5
21,the room has a balcony with a chair and table very clean comfortable queen bed breakfast wasnt too bad not much selection the pool is on the roof at times it gets busy but you can sit and enjoy the viewsbaggage  storage is a bit risky cause its just a room you go and drop ur bag  there and leave anyone can go and take whatever they wantthe staff are friendly,5/5
22,next to metaxourgeio metro area has a bad vibe but staff are friendly rooms are certainly not  star quality but got us by need more plug sockets as the were only two and in conveniently located bathroom needs a window as extractor was not doing a good job if youre on a tight budget then this is your place unfortunately we wont be staying here again breakfast was average,3/5
23,there has never been a place whose website photos and description are more deceptive than this dump we booked it because the reviews were decent and the rooms looked nice from the pictures we even upgraded to the superior room with acropolis view then we arrived to discover the biggest baitandswitch of all timefirst of all there is no acropolis view it doesnt exist from any room in the hotel so dont pay for this if youre still going to waste your money at this place from any room that faces the hotel the acropolis particularly the parthenon that sits atop it is totally blocked by any buildings between you and it if you think youre going to get a photo of it from your room it will look as awful as the one im sharing with the nearby rooftop hot water tank totally blocking it the view they share on their website is from their rooftop bar which is absolutely nothing special  just some lousy wire mesh tables with zero decoralso dont pay for a superior room the website photos show a little sitting area for the superior room that our room didnt have when i went to the front desk to ask why our room was so tiny when we paid for a superior the response was that our room was higher i asked so theres no other difference between a superior room and the less expensive comfort room other than the floor number the guy said noalso when we checked in we wanted to clean up from our travels only to find that the shower was missing the hook to hold the detachable hand held showerhead again i brought this to the front desks attention and the response was well you can just hold it nicethe bathroom is laid out in the worst possible way to get between the sink and the toilet you actually have to turn sideways and crabwalkshuffle through this is not hyperbole  if you are a male and you want to stand to pee stay somewhere elselastly you know the paper that doctors offices use to pull over the exam tables as the last line of defense between that table and your bare behind apparently they make entire bedsheets out of that same paper and they have them at candia hotel athens theyre not just scratchy but somehow theyre actually noisy sheets they crinkle when you or your partner moves even the slightest bit so if the texture of the sheets doesnt ruin your sleep the sound of the sheets sure willlastly lastly  the location is awful it looks close to stuff on a map but youll be on the metro to get to anything you want to see,1/5
24,convenient hotel with relatively quiet rooms above all we were pleased with the view of the acropolis from the top floor and the friendliness of the staff many thanks to babiswho looked after us perfectly and cooled us off with very tasty cocktails,5/5
25,during my stay at this hotel for a competition in february  i enjoyed the breakfast offerings and found the location to be relatively convenient despite minor difficulties navigating public transportation options nearby unfortunately my experience was marred somewhat by limited shower space of approximately  feet by  feet square footage resulting into puddles on bathroom floors furthermore upon returning from sightseeing excursion with properly secured accommodations my personal belonging necklace went mysteriously missing hotel personnel demonstrated negligible interesteffort resolving said issue and i stayed there for several days and everyday i asked if they found it they just became more and more irritated by my persistent asking and my necklace never showed up,3/5
26,paid through lastminute and cancel within  hour after seeing some very bad reviews on health and safety the hotel took the money without bother to refund avoid at all cost,1/5
27,the hotel was lovelyfive minute walk to nearest metrostaff were very welcoming nothing was too much for the young man at receptionrooms were basic and cleaned daily this suited us as we were ou most of the dayfood was lovelythe roof pool and restaurant were small but the views made up for them,5/5
28,we held a conference for  days we rented some rooms and had breakfast lunch and dinner everything was on notch dont have any complaints rooms were clean food was great and a lot which was great and requests that i asked were done will totally continue to use their hotel,5/5
29,sorry to be rude but this hotel was a big disappointment  our toilet door didnt work so you need to hear and smell what your partner is doing when they use the toilet rooms are run down and in total need of refurbishment on the bright side the roof top bar is lovely with nice views of the acropolis also hotel staff is very friendly,1/5
30,no way this place a  stars hotel a  stars at best its only saving grace is the roof bar and views,2/5
31,cleaning of the rooms shall be improved there is dust under the bed in the corners of the room on the furniture bed linen is clean maximum  stars,2/5
32,the rooms are mid theres a maximum of  outlets narrow spaces where you cant fit your luggages if you have more than one there are also broken plugs which is obviously dangerous as well as doors both for the foyer and balcony dont forget to visit their rooftop because it will serve you a nice view during sunset the air conditioning is great too the breakfast on the other hand is bland and not enjoyable it has a lot of bread in the buffet though the dining area lacks ventilation the people eating in there are literally sweating as they eat overall its tolerable hotel for a few days stay the nice and well polished lobby raised my expectations but got disappointed right away when we entered the room that obviously looks old,3/5
33,hotel looks like it is been used and abused for so long without proper maintenance everything works though but there are flaws everywhere it has a  star sign in the entrance but i would never agree with that from the outside it has a modern look but from inside i guess it was an old hotel with renovation on top of it positive sides are location  close to metro and train station close to center omonia good internet coverage inside,3/5
34,the hotel is old the elevator the furniture the rooms the bathrooms and the beds need to be updated there is no good place to plug in chargers we had to crawl under the table and unplug the coffee maker so we could access one plug the only good thing is the breakfast buffet,1/5
35,really nice view from the top nice swimming pool but lots of people and difficult for me to swim the room wasnt what i expected though but nice cleaning service and nice breakfast for all for me i really thought the breakfast was based on lots of egg,5/5
36,great hotel right in the middle of everything in athens easy subway access and walking distance to the big archaeological sites,5/5
37,updated the review to  starsroompretty old and rundown but clean few outlets mediocre lighting the wc had some what i think were harmless small bugs but bugs nonetheless very small flying bugs a spider or two small wc overall but it was okroom was fairly big and as we were on the sixth floor we had a great view of athens from the rather large balconylocationpretty close to athens centre and its attractions walkable distance to acropolis and quite close to metro stations easy to get a cabpretty bad neighborhood though graffiti and somewhat dirty almost everywhere in the vicinity with few exceptions lots of junkies dumpsterdivers that said we had no issues with the locals basically its a poor neighborhood but still civilized as far as we could tell for our two days there so if you dont care about that stuff the location can be considered higher than my rating due to how close it is to other attractionsfrom the top floor theres a decent looking pool that we didnt try and a good view of athens due to the neighborhood its not all a great view but still quite the viewbreakfast was ok nothing specialservice was fine helpful with questions and some good advice for our excursions no issues there,2/5
38,the terrace is incredible and the rooms spectacularthe stuff are very friendly and ready to serve you,5/5
39,great hotel close to subway  min walk to two different stops  i preferred the larissas station as it is more direct and on same major street as the hotel is on stops and you are at the acropolis which by the way you can see from the rooftop floor that has a pool bar tables and chairs and dont miss seeing the acrop all lit up from the hotelrooms are good size for europe and even has room for a tubshower combo instead of just a  ft x  ft shower for most of europe that u cant even move around in much less get clean inwe had a good buffet bkfst every morning not sure if that is standard or extra cost as it was part of our tour group but more than the standard continental ones u find across europethe hotel might not be in walking distance to popular places but with the subway it only takes  to  minutes to get to most of the places u want to see and is very convenient i would stay there again in a heartbeat no questions asked,4/5
40,the entire candia hotel staff is to be commended for their pleasantness and friendliness the food was delicious and varied the breakfast and dinner buffet was filled with many enticing greek specialities and everyone was able to fill their plate at each meal they even had greek coffee you cook in sand the rooms were clean and many had views of the acropolis and fantastic large balconies the rooftop pool was small but useful after a long day of hiking all of athens the hotels location was good too as it was an easy walk to a metro station and close to other useful shops,4/5
41,rooms are a little plainjane but the pool the bar and the restaurant on the roof redeemed everything else the whole stay was quite nice,5/5
42,if you want to enjoy your trip free of bedbugs and you like cleanliness do not stay at this place cannot understand how this hotel is rated as a  stars hotel we pay for  stars and get  stars maybe they just rated the breakfast,1/5
43,this hotel was what we needed to go rest up a bit for a day to explore greecegeorge the front desk dude was a kind man that accommodated us weary travels so if you see him smiling he will be a rainbow of sunshine for your tripthe pool and facilities are quite nice,5/5
44,ive loved my trip to athènes but this hotel ugh i went to a trip with my friends and our hotel room was so little we couldnt even put all our luggage on the floor but the rest was okay but beware of the security guy because once me and my friends stepped on a chair on the balcony and he the security guy thought we were thiefs he went to our room and yelled to us he went inside our hotel room without asking we were really freaking out but thats not the end because once my friend lost her health card and he was insistent about looking into our room really creepy but the rest was okay but when i tell you we ere terrified but the guy,2/5
45,i am absolutely furious about my stay with you i was shocked to find hair in my towels and in my blanket which is frankly disgusting also the dirt on the bathroom ceiling was just disgustingalso i was really unhappy that several outlets in the room were not working properly which caused me problems charging my electronics also it was simply unacceptable that only one of the two lights in the room worked properly making the room dark and uninvitingi have to say that these problems have greatly spoiled my experience in your establishment and i find this unacceptable i expected the location and ambiance to make up for these shortcomings but unfortunately that was not the casei urge you to take my comments seriously and take immediate action to improve the cleanliness of your rooms and repair the electrical problems in the rooms,1/5
46,dont stay here without exaggerating this hotel is so bad its unworthy of the name best western and the standard of quality weve all come to expect the room i stayed in was cramped with  uncomfortable twin beds had no bedroom lights literally the only lights consisted of  above the door and  in the cramped washroom and the shoddy room looked nothing like the photos the entire surrounding neighbourhood is a ghetto with drug dealers and pickpockets a fellow traveller had just witnessed a mugging down the street literally every single building is covered in trashy graffiti and its located directly beside train tracks to make sure the trains wake you at night the neighbourhood is not safely walkable to anywhere worthwhile as the entire area is so rundown my wife and i didnt wanna risk going out for dinner so we ate in at the hotel buffet this was a huge mistake for  per person you get to share in a feast so cheap and awful with a room full of other travellers who are equally miserable and disgusted by the food complete ripoff and an utter disappointment if you dont believe me read up on the omonoia area of athens avoid this place,1/5
47,basic clean hotel we stayed there  nights with  kids had everything we needed hotel staff all very friendly and accomodatingbreakfast was good staff helped to make sure our allergic daughter could eat some food tooroof top was nice and had amazing views of acropolis the pool was open late and the kids could cool down while we enjoyed cocktails from the bar,4/5
48,do yourself a favor and dont stay here the only reason i gave more than one star is because of the bartender by the pool he was the only highlight of our stay and went out of his way to be helpful and kind honestly i hope he gets a raise because he is truly a treasurenow for the hotel itself how it has a  star rating is beyond me this place is horribleto start the entire hotel is hot and humid the air conditioner in our room was set to  and the fan on high but the room stayed uncomfortable hot we brought this to the attention of the front desk they checked it and said there was nothing they could doour beds were like sleeping on box springs they are rock solid sheetsblankets are scratchy and the mattress protector had not been washed as there was a urine patch that smelled horriblywe also had bedbugs luckily they only seemed to like me and didnt bite our kids but im covered in biteswe booked here because they had a pool and breakfast the pool is tiny and usually filled with people kids playing are met with glares even when they are well behavedbreakfast has a lot of options if you get there early if you dont get there before the rush there will be no bacon or crepesneedless to say we did not enjoy our stay its very overpriced for what they offer,2/5
49,we are a family with small kids and stayed for one night the pool is nice so is the roof area but the bar on the roof only opens at  the rooms were ok so was the breakfast the night buffet not recommended and the whole area is not that suited for kids so we didnt really go out with them to grab something to eat,3/5
50,rooms are a bit outdated and noisy but everything is clean the rooftop is very very beautiful and really makes the hotel great we read about the neighbourhood being unsafe but we never really felt unsafe,4/5
51,i stayed in this hotel with my family the rooms were alright but the thing i want to emphasize is their breakfast it was awesome if you have children who love to eat their day will be made the hotels location makes it easy to catch a commute easily another great point about this hotel was the reception the people manning it were very helpful i would definitely recommend this hotelpoonam smith,4/5
52,the biggest benefit of this hotel is that its within an easy walking distance to the train station the rooms are very simple and clean though the noise from the street neighbors through the walls pipes and such made it hard to sleep unfortunately,3/5
53,i really loved the food here my compliments to the cooking staffthe rooms were really clean and well equipped if you are with more than  personsthe rooftop garden is not actually a garden but more a rooftop terrace with a bar that unfortunately only is open in the evening and a small poollocation is pretty good we could get anywhere we wantedwhen we were in the h floor however we encountered some unwanted guests but that was gladly only limited to the meeting room and not other roomsoverall i wish i could stay here longer its a good hotel,4/5
54,the room is a bit small and old however the rooftop is just fully renovated and stunning i arrived early morning  am and they didnt make any problem at check in times and directly provided me a room the pool and roof is so amazing  degrees views all over athens the employees friendly and helpful to answer all your questions the hotel is very quiet and also the cleaning lady super helpful located next to the train directly to the airport also the views and rooftop bar are open at night very much recommended big supermarket in the same street just  minutes walk also the breakfast was included and you have soo much choices of fruit bread yoghurts etc even near the end of breakfast time at  am thank you so much for making my stay unforgettable i absolutely enjoyed,5/5
55,pretty close to everything nice clean rooms friendly staff private restroomsbeds are stiff but thats the only negative they use a pretty interesting key for entering the rooms and turning on the lights and acoverall its a great stay for those that want to spend all day outside the hotel and come back to a safe environment after a long day,5/5
56,initially trying to get there was a bit of a mission but was fine parking was somewhat of an issue but plenty of street parking just need to look for it aside from that check in process was fairly easy and got in had to pay a fee of  aside from hotel charge but it was fine the room was clean a bit old but all good mine came with a balcony with a decent view no room service so had to go to lobby to buy water but overall decent and budget stay for the price paid,4/5
57,big rooms great service long breakfast menuloved the place as there were indian restaurants in walkable distance and also a great view of acropolis from the roof bar,5/5
58,the service is excellent rooms spacy and always clean minus one star for the filthy neighborhood there two metro stations really close though and the keramikos area on a walking distance of five minstayed for four days my back got fixed i want this bed at home asap,4/5
59,nice hotel very close to the centre trainstation and metro the neighbourhood is not the best of athens nice staff very friendly the room and bathroom were very clean the terrace with pool at the roof is great with a fantastic view over athens and the acropolis the terrace is under construction but almost ready the breakfast is more than sufficient,5/5
60,very good first stop on our tripthe good had a pool very cold great breakfast and service was top notchthe bad the beds were rock hard and were two twins pushed together not an actual queenking,4/5
61,it is a few minutes walk from larissa station or direct train from athens airport on the suburban train the hotel feels like it caters for groups and has a hostel type feel although is a hotel breakfast is reasonable i wouldnt say it is a romantic getaway but a good functional base for visiting athens,3/5
62,good  stars hotel provided relevant accommodation location is close to the center of athens but located in front of the railway station and a big boulevard which makes it very noisy caused with the low level of noise reduction windows every room has its small balcony with table and  chairs there are free wifi but during the evenings the quality is poor there is a nice terrace with pool and bar on the roof but again the vie to acropolis is very limited,4/5
63,very nice hotel  walking distance to the underground stations  breakfast was decent  prices were fair and the rooms were good  i cant complain  i didnt have any issues here  cheers,5/5
64,i have stayed at this hotel it was the worst nights sleep i ever had there are bedbugs and they are everywhere got no sleep highly do not recommend staying in this hotel had to go to the pharmacy next day,1/5
65,everything is fine the pool is fine with a nice view on the rooftop the rooms and bathroom are fine if a little small location is good however the bedspillows are rock solid it feels like i just slept on a table all night,2/5
66,located close by to a metro station but the area itsself is not the nicest area of athensit was also unfortunate that i seemed to have dropped by during the only few days their entire rooftop terrace was closedthe staff is exceptionally friendly but unfortunately the rooms are a little bit small and old,3/5
67,we have stayed at this hotel it was very well located with amazing views from the roof terrace and a little swimming pool to enjoy acropolis and athens skyline the restaurant serves quality food and the service is very good i would highlight the staff kindness reception cleaning people and olga greetings fron susana in charge of the bar roof terrace highly recommended a little drawback is the noise of greek traffic,5/5
68,we stayed here for three nights and booked a room for  unfortunately the rooms including the bathroom are really small the three beds almost didnt fit in therethe pool is unfortunately closed during offseason so it was closed when we were therethe hotel is located right next to a busy road and train tracks so it can be noisy during the night and you cant sleep with the window open the metro station is a  minute walk from the hotel and its  stations away from city centerthe breakfast was good quite busy but plenty of food and actually better than expectedthere is a bar located in the basement with friendly barkeeper and a good place to hang out in the evening because unfortunately there is nothing in walking distance,3/5
69,tiny bathroom noisy air conditioning hard mattress old and shabby hotel the room was not clean breakfast is just eatable how come it is a  star hotel maximum two best western watch out your partners,2/5
70,everything perfect besides some stuff from the breakfast being off brand  untestable like the orange juice the cake  the egg pasta looking thing also we were at the rd floor  the train below was piercing our ears while trying to sleep,5/5
71,a rather old hotel but clean with a very good breakfast the staff is very friendly and helpful thank you alexandros to get us out of a rather stressful situation when we arrived,4/5
72,very comfortable hotel all that you need friendly  polite staff close to metro station we kept going to the city centre good breakfast unbelievable part being u actually get breakfast here at  in the morning something i found was really good  will remember this experience we had a early ferry to mýkonos we actually had breakfast as early at   hospitality industry is all about service  comfort  bringing smiles this hotel sure does a marvellous job,4/5
73,the dinner service closes at  and we asked for a pizza at  and they say yes and  minutes later they say the kitchen is closed very upset with the service,2/5
74,cons we had booked a couple room and we were provided a room with  single beds they dont have enough staff to help their customers u need to go to the reception to find out anything their mattress are like rocks not sure why they have kept such bad quality matressprothe breakfast had good options,1/5
75,rooms are compact and you dont have much space inside room to move aroundbathroom tub is so small that you will hit walls while taking bathwe booked double bedroom but they have provided  separate beds for us seriouslyyou wont find any supporting staff who will take you luggage to room or help with any issues you face in the room you need to contact reception either via phone or personally for all the queriessurrounding areas are not safe to roam around at nightonly advantage is its near to metro and bus station thats it,1/5
76,rooftop pool has the most gorgeous view breakfast included is great and staff are  on the desk to help out with anything location is a bit out but very close to a train station great stay,5/5
77,lovely hotel around a  minute walk from the centre of athens great buffet dinner range and breakfast the staff are very accommodating and friendly there is also a rooftop terrace with views of the acropolis and the city,5/5
78,for a greek star hotel ok very friendly service food and meal ok with a lot of salad and vegetablesthe rooms are small and simplethe free wifi in our room in the fifth floor was rather badthe pool is rather small but the bar and the view at the top of the hotel is really nice,4/5
79,average accommodation as the hotel shows its age accesibile by metro half distance between metaxourghiou and larissa stations good views from the topon the downsidewifi was a dissapointment as it worked intermitentlyour room facing the bulevard was a bit noisy in the morning from the street trafficif you take breakfast near the end of the schedule you can barely find certain food as they dont replenish itif you are from a noneur country and pay by credit card take care to select payment in eur by default they will try to perform the payment in your home currency at a very disadvantageous exchange rate,3/5
80,one of the worst hotels that i have ever stayed at the location has no decent restaurants nearby and the traffic and train station noise will keep you awake at nightthe quality of the intermal restaurant buffet food us also very basic and ordinarythe quality of the rooms are very very poor and datedi chose this hotel thinking that it would be good quality being a best western hotel however i made a big mistakewould not give this any stars if i couldwould stronly recommend that you avoid this hotel,1/5
81,dont pay extra for the balcony its smaller than a bathtub with very limited viewpool on roof top is ok,1/5
82,no bedbugs my husband and i were booked to stay here for  nights to see athens and enjoy the tours we didnt mind the outdated decor or the hard beds with one pillow we didnt even mind waiting for the room for  hours or the unkept bathroom we were so exhausted from our  hour flight that we flopped onto the bed and went to sleep for  hours we didnt even unpack or change when we woke up my husband looked down and saw a rather large bedbug on the floor i jumped up immediately and we flipped the mattresses they were there alive and well some were squished some were thriving we left immediately the hotel tried to get us another best western hotel without success then tried to put us in another room we waited in the lobby for another  hours as our travel agent and others tried to find us a hotel we were hungry tired disgusted and angry while we waited we decided to eat at the hotel since it was the only thing close by and we didnt want to drag our luggage around they still charged us for food but hey the one glass of wine was on the house we ended up blowing most of our honeymoon money on the only hotel available because it is high season on the marriott all in all leaving was the best decision we could have made even if we cant eat out much or go on some tours bedbugs would have destroyed this honeymoon do not stay here,1/5
83,we were incredibly disappointed with the candia athens hotel our cab driver from the airport was a bit confused why two people on their honeymoon would be staying here we were not sure what to make of this until we arrived the hotel is located in the center of a very rundown and less than savory neighborhood the hotel is more than a  minue cab ride from anything of note in or around the plaka we asked the cab driver if walking would be faster to which he vehemently discouraged citing safety the gentleman at the front desk was rude and univiting we reserved a double bed we were on our honeymoon but were provided with three separate twin beds upon presenting our reservation for a double bed room to the previously rude clerk he became angry and slid a new key across the counter upon entering the new room the view was of a fire escape and the loading dock and the bathroom door would not close due to the sink being in the way the manager was equally unwelcoming and rude she essentially said not my problem we left without a refund and stayed at the central hotel for only  more a night but x better in every way avoid this hotel like its your job,1/5
84,very small room even m small bath you can not turn around in itcomplete hotel is in its age worn outsee my fotos breakfast is a jokebeautyfull view to acropolis from roof friendly staffi will not come back,2/5
85,not staying at hotel but had a drink on the rooftop amazing with incredible views and roof top swimming pool staff are lovely,5/5
86,i stayed few nights breakfast was awesome theres a bar conference room if you want to celebrate birthday party or any sort of celebration location is great you can walk to all the ancient places and monuments services awesome,4/5
87,this hotel is one of the best and the best accommodation to my heart in greece athens is about  meters from the larisses metro station this place is relatively quiet with the rest of athens i enjoyed this hotel and my family will make this hotel my next stay,5/5
88,just old small rooms bathroom pocket door didnt close properly and was open about  cm more like a star hotel the roof patio was nice until late cockroaches came out,2/5
89,good hotel located walkimg distance from the metro station we had a early ferry to mikonos and the breakfast was ready at  am which was amazing we could catch a bite before leaving nice people on the front desk very helpful and courteous,4/5
90,just terrible not one positive about this hotel definitely not  stars,1/5
91,this was barely better than a youth hostel the shower was a disaster for starters i didnt know why everything including the toilet paper rolls was soaking wet when i went to use it but maybe having a shower head  foot off the ground and a curtain that was too short had something to do with it the power outlet was falling out of the wall and there was a fire exit staircase to the ground outside my window which had no bars or locks mind you not a  star hotel dont let the best western name fool you,2/5
92,i was assigned to room  first day i woke up with itches but didnt think much of it second day i saw rashes and the itches went all over my body and realised it was bed bug found one and crushed it blood splattered was fresh my blood of course called them up to check it out they moved me to different room offered me free dinner which i didnt use as i get really anxious about their hygiene standards im surprised that they didnt even offer to refund my first and second nights as it is definitely ruin my holiday as i was walking around scratching myself raw had to cancel my massage appointment as im embarrassed by the state of my skin and body im so disappointed that they are still happy to take away my money afterall their negligent and poor housekeeping  but i hate of confrontation and trying to enjoy my holiday the best i can but if i could give zero star i probably would,1/5
93,we stayed  days room was basic but clean only  min walk from nat archelogical museuma must see much appreciated reception staff especially george who gave us all the info we needed to either get metroto acropolis bus or how to get anywhere he was also very helpful in getting us great  day tourgo tours to delphi which we much enjoyed and on our last day he suggested visit to the temple of poisedon explained how to get bus to get there we loved this sea coast ride to this magical destination another great day special thanks to george for his helpful  friendly suggestions breakfast was exceptional great variety much enjoyed as well nice spot on roof top for drink in evening with spectacular view of parthenon,4/5
94,dont go out on the balconies they have do not enter signs for a reason and bring a power strip as your room will likely only have one outlet the roof terrace is lovely though and a great place to watch the sunset,3/5

168,nice hotel,5/5
169, we were very pleased in every respect even though we were staying with two ladies in a central location very close to the metro station the hotel felt safe for us even late at night the hotel staff is very friendly and helpful our room is very convenient and clean and hygienic there is a refrigerator and kettle in the room breakfast was nice with lots of variety most of the hotel has been renovated and modernized those who want to come can come with peace of mind,5/5
170, the hotel has its own atmosphere coffee making facilities water fridge air conditioning in the room comfortable beds clean varied breakfasts delicious coffee desserts everyone will find something for themselves at the reception cookies and water available all the time very helpful staff the hotel is undergoing renovation nothing you dont mind the view from the terrace the firecracker the swimming pool is clean you can cool down after a whole day of sightseeing the location is great  minutes to the metro  minutes by bus even closer to syntagma square on foot about  minutes taxi from monastiraki square e and on foot about  minutes close to everything i dont know why someone wrote uninteresting neighborhood most of the side streets and in the center there are homeless people lying on the street they dont bother anyone,5/5
171, fairly spacious and moderately clean rooms equipped with essential comforts including a much appreciated fridge and balcony varied and abundant international breakfast with a large choice of both sweet and savory in a large room the idea of the swimming pool and bar area on the top floor overlooking the city is very nice the only flaw is the rather dirty water good location as the center is easily reachable on foot but some areas do not appear to be the most reliable especially if you are alone or during the hours of darkness all in all my experience was positive i stayed for three nights during a group trip,4/5
172, the evening meal miserable about  people should be served within half an hourin the room we stayed in the bed covers were stained and looked unwashed the blankets were shabby worn and i dont know how long they might have been in the closet the bathroom although it looked clean smelled strongly of mold even the shower curtain had yellow stains on itthe staff was inexpressive and unsmiling and i would dare to say that at one point it was also rudeunacceptable for a four star hotel the photos on the hotels website in no way correspond to reality,1/5
173, to avoid reception not a smile we spent one night there and that was enough for uswe were on the street side which overlooks the train line the area is not very reassuringthe rooms need to be renovated made of cardboard you have the impression of living with others the night was really noisyin short i dont recommend,1/5
174, fantastic crazy  star luxury supremacy hotel the windows are not acoustically insulated and for this reason at night i hear the noise of the tracks which remind me of the battle of stalingrad and this gives me ptsd they will return,5/5
175, this hotel is fine the beds are comfortable and it has the subway and train next to it the pool on the terrace is very small but it is good for cooling off breakfast quite good ,5/5
176, an outdated hotel with a great rooftop pool environment is not particularly inviting the parking garage and subway are within walking distance which is very positive breakfast is good but you have to note that the staff really packs everything up when the time is over rather unprofessional behavior if you want to sleep cheaper in a hotel in athens you are in good hands there also suitable for families but you have to be careful which room you get it can happen that as a family of four you are accommodated in a room that is much too small in general it is very clean but as i said a bit old,3/5
177, great hotel within walking distance of the metro elevators are available so that disabled people can also use this hotel roof terrace with swimming pool and excellent breakfast in the morning good place to discover athens from there,5/5
178, it is a half renovated hotel only floors   and the terrace have been renovated the rest are from the s ,3/5
179, courage beautiful hotel in probably recently bombed neighborhoodvery noisy environment day and night nearby train station and lane roaddont forget a gun for walking around the neighborhoodhotel wedged between an old taxi depot and an abandoned train stationthe only positive point is the terrace the only deserved starfor the staff with one or two exceptions we were not well received the feeling was that we were disturbing,1/5
180, the hotel room on the th floor is very nice you can tell that it has been renovated the terrace is good however the rest of the building is not in good condition it looks very old the elevators in addition to being dirty give a feeling of insecurity the location of the hotel is not bad but not good either the reception staff is very unfriendly it seems that they were bothering us when checking in during the stay they did not feel like approaching them to ask any questions about any concerns in conclusion although the renovated room was good the hotel as a whole is not at all what one expects in a star hotel,3/5
181, very old without good heating there was no reading light on the nd bedside table lack of cleaning dirty faces inexpressive employees in the morning small stale and reheated the bread machine was problematic as if it had no heating the place was cold and the music from the radio you could hear naan and commercials while there were many touristsit is close to the center and mostly to the metro,2/5
182, superb hotel with a view of the parthenon on the rooftop with swimming pool we had a renovated room that was very spacious and very clean the breakfast is very complete the rooftop restaurant also offers good local dishes at affordable prices the hotel is located  minutes walk from the metro and you arrive in the center in  minutes we are very happy with our stay,5/5
183, the hotel was okay enough but the surrounding area was very worn and not particularly cozy it was fine around the eateries but i dont recommend going out after midnight wasnt a good place the hotel was far from the center but close to larissa and metaxourghio station which takes you to ermou shopping street or acropolis in minutes only  euro for a single ticket one waywe got large nice newly refurbished rooms on the th floor with no view but fortunately little noise from the street two separate beds with tv for a family of  i dont think all the hotel rooms are equally renovated they had a top terrace with a pool and a view of the acropolis the hotel is located near a busy road so avoid rooms facing this we did not eat at the hotel and the service was perfectly fine  star hotel i think candia was expensive compared to the whole package you geti would probably rather choose hotels closer to the center next time in plaka syntagma or acropolis,3/5
184, the hotel disappointed us a lot because of its location at night it was quite scary to walk because of the hotel itself very oldfashioned and with views of the neighbors and a rather dilapidated area as well as the room we were a couple and they gave us a room with three beds so it seemed like a hostel for spending a night or group trips the bathroom was uncomfortable very high bathtub and the closets with sliding doors were uncomfortable to open the breakfast was horrible of average quality so we were not happy at all the only good things about the hotel were the receptionist who was very friendly and helpful the proximity of the metro and the athens archaeological museum i certainly wouldnt go back to the hotel,2/5
185, a disappointment more than average welcome no smile we had the impression of disturbing each timeelevators out of service  times a daythe limited room see the photosthe decent breakfast with choice is what deserves the star with the view from the roofthe water in the pool is cloudylocated  streets from the homeless and drug addicts a good twenty on the sidewalkin short i dont recommend it at all i spent  nights there but i will not return and do not recommend it,1/5
186, this hotel particularly impressed me despite the reviews not being entirely positive the rooms were very spacious and modern the bathroom slightly small as far as the service at the reception is concerned they are very friendly and ready to meet your every need the strong point of the hotel is undoubtedly the swimming pool which is located on one of the top floors which presents a breathtaking view over the entire city of athensthe food buffet is very varied with good and less good things a flaw of this hotel is certainly the location which is a bit far from the center and in a somewhat dangerous area despite this hotel approved,4/5
187, we spent  nights upon arrival from our trip to the cyclades small dilapidated room not possible to go around the bed with the suitcase open bathroom from another era good beddingon return  nights but large room with balcony on the boulevard de la gare clean good beddingdilapidated bathroom no pressure in the shower which was in poor conditionon the other hand great view of the parthenon day and night it was magnificentgood location to visit athenscold welcomebut doesnt deserve  stars,3/5
188, everything is miserable the reception is inadequate the room there are no words all i will say is that i lost  for a fourbed room and my children freaked out because the airconditioning did not work unacceptable big shame for dealing with the problems by the people in charge,1/5
189, it is a half renovated hotel only floors   and the terrace have been renovated the rest are from the swe had two rooms reserved and they gave us one in the fifth and another in the th so we could compare them the ones in the fifth are new completely renovated and still smell something like paint the one on the fourth was disastrous horrible we asked for a change and they gave us an adjoining room on the fifth floori dont know why they didnt do it first with free roomsthe receptionist was very unfriendly as if we were bothering her the rest of the service is friendlythe terrace has a swimming pool and has a good view of the acropolisthe neighborhood is not very good there are a lot of beggars and everything is very dirty the only advantage is that there is a police station next door and it gives a bit of peace of mindgetting to the center on foot is about  kmyou can go by taxi or uber but be careful with what they charge since a taxi driver wanted to charge us  but i only gave him  and i accepted the normal range is between  and ,3/5
190, lazy and pissedoff stafffew towels for the swimming pool where you can not see the acropolis there is a bar in the middle you have to go to the other side of the terrace ,3/5
191, this hotel in spain would have fewer stars it is not bad but it could frankly be improved the room was spacious but the walls needed maintenance filling and painting the bathroom is quite old with a bathtub and ,3/5
192, good location  stops by metro from the center of athens minutes walking to the temple of apollovery simple rooms with some defectsto highlight the service of waiters and receptionists very attentive helpful and very friendlywe were attended to in the afternoon by vasiliki a wonderful womanin the morning a very serious but very cooperative manthe terrace with pool and views of the acropolis of athenseverything perfect highly recommended,4/5
193, staff who are jaded unprofessional and who seem to be discovering the profession if we remove the roof terrace with its view and the breakfast it remains a very average hotel which needs to seriously renovate its rooms and in an unsafe area swimming pool which is only for decoration little extra metro nearby,1/5
194, very bad for a  starthe refrigerator didnt work very old rooms very unpleasant receptionists come on it has everything to not repeat the experiencei dont advise it to anyoneit has  stars left over,1/5
195, good location of the hotel  minutes walk to the train station and metro bar on the roof terrace with a pool open into the night with a beautiful view the pool does not have very clean water throughout the day but there is a shower right next to the pool so you can take a shower a drink during happy hour will cost you  for  eur unfortunately there is more ice in the glasses than drinks hotel service pleasant breakfast without problems the rooms would like to be renovated the floor is ruined and there are holes in it stains and cracks on the walls some rooms have a view of the courtyard  the fire escapekettle hair dryer fridge available in the room a bottle of water awaits you in your rooma mailbox is available directly at the hotel entrance,4/5
196, hotel in a bad location this part of the city is scaryrooms and services shouldnt even have a threestar rating much less be a hotel with a fourstar ratingvery basic breakfast for a four star hotelreceptionists do not create any empathy with customersbad experience i dont recommend,2/5
197, in the top great view of the acropolis great bar and pool  cocktail purchased   offered from  pm to  pm do not miss great breakfast after not being great on the dish offerings its not a restaurant the rooms are very functional small fridge tv,5/5
198, the hotel is nowhere near a  star it is a  star in spainit needs  good renovationand one of the waiters speaks to me in spanish at firstand then he tells me in english that he doesnt speak spanish sorry what are you talking aboutno attention and little desire to help the spanish clientele thank you very much for making things easy for me and for bacilating meand about dinner between courses you digest we end up leaving without waiting for dessertim adding more comments right now because we ordered takeaway breakfast the day before and we dont have anything and they dont even botheri do not recommend the hotel at all flee if you can to anotherhalf board is worthless just to waste your money,1/5
199, excellent base for a city trip to athens the hotel rooms are clean but dated small room with pieces of furniture that are much too large very hard beds doesnt sleep well breakfast was okay but not special roof terrace makes up for a lot beautiful views over the city and a nice swimming pool make it complete,3/5
200, really nice hotel we were upgraded to a better room for free from comfort room to superior room really good rooftop both in the evening and during the day however the pool was only about  m deep ,4/5
201,  nights upon arrival one night upon departure well were not going to lie the negative opinions are pretty accurate the rooms are borderline not comfortable noisy the location is really not great for visiting the city really positive point the rooftop the swimming pool well the small pool being full to bursting all the time i havent tried it but the view is really great the breakfast is average the bar on the rooftop is just as average plastic glasses poorly executed cocktails i honestly dont know where the  stars come from,3/5
202, we stayed  nightswe had a room in the renovated part on the th floor so that was super nice as i had read negative reviews about the hotel accommodation being quite datedhotel quite well located close to the metro with small traditional restaurantsa top roof with a very pleasant small swimming poolclassic breakfastsatisfied,4/5
203, the hotel is well located not far from a metro station the room was comfortable with a small balcony overlooking the station so very noisy the staff were very accommodating we had to leave before breakfast time so they gave us some cakes and fruit before opening the breakfast room breakfast for other gueststhe roof terrace with the swimming pool offers a beautiful view of the acropolis,4/5
204, terrible customer treatment the woman at the reception seems to do it on purpose she is neither helpful nor does anything the half board leaves a lot to be desired they clearly make bad food so that you go up to the roof to eat and thus give yourself another blow bad neighborhood simply before considering this site look at others even if they are more expensive they are surely more worth it,2/5
205, for a star hotel the rooms and hallways are quite dated it has a metro stop quite close the best is the terrace which is very large with views of the acropolis and the pool,3/5
206, the hotel is on a very noisy street right next to the subway tracks if the windows of the room face this street you can only sleep with the balcony door closed and with earplugs the balcony is also quite dirty the tables and chairs on the balcony are not wiped down either everything is dirtyin the bar upstairs all the tables sway so you can only put a glass of wine on the table at your own risk so that it doesnt spillhowever the rooftop bar offers a nice view of the city ,3/5
207, if you manage to avoid the huge number of yonikis in the horrible destroyed neighborhood in which it is located you will reach a hotel that the stars must have lost the only good thing is the terrace and the views the pool is free but it is a puddle,2/5
208, hotel located in the center good conditions good breakfast nice service greek  stars are polish ,3/5
209, for location hotel located in a bad area of athens with a view of its poor sidefor tranquility you can forget bring earplugs the walls are thin you can hear everything ,3/5
210, a good hotel overall contrary to some negative reviews i just stayed there for  nights to discover athens my standard room was very well equipped recently renovated very clean and pleasant the bathroom is certainly small but remains functional because it is well designed and very beautiful the only downside for the room is that the window lets in street noise despite the double glazing which did not prevent me from sleeping wellas for the hotel staff i give them all  for their attentiveness kindness service and smilevery decent breakfast varied salty and sweetcorrect evening buffetvery nice rooftop with the possibility of eating there and of course a bar,4/5
211, i recommend very nice hotel with great service friendly staff modern and spacious room the awesome rooftopthe neighborhood is not scary at all we were able to walk alone in the street without worryi will go back,5/5
212, it is not a  star hotel by any means more like a  star old and poorly maintained rooms the service is terrible a lot of carelessness on the part of the employees zero attention from them we asked them to prepare breakfast for us because we were going on an excursion and when we went to pick it up they said there was nothing and they were wider than long the location is quite central but in a neighborhood of junkies and homeless people we had to go down another street because the one that took us directly to the hotel was scary to go through there,1/5
213, this hotel in spain would have fewer stars it is not bad but it could frankly be improved the room was spacious but the walls needed maintenance filling and painting the bathroom is quite old with a bathtub and taps the tv was in a corner and fortunately there was a channel in spanish and many in other languages besides greekbreakfast was quite good as was dinner although the hot dishes are not hot but lukewarm the last day the electrical system broke down and we had to walk our suitcases down and the hotel was left without air conditioningthe views from the terrace are great and it is very good ideal for having a drink before going to sleepthe exterior is somewhat delicate it is in the border area with drugs and things like that but we had no problems,3/5
214, old hotel old common areas  welcome not a smile nor hello nor thank you on all floorsdirty poollocation correct,1/5
215, the rooms are not comfortable nor soundproofed the cleanliness leaves something to be desired the sanitary facilities the breakfast is deplorable,1/5
216, we walked from the acropolis to the hotel i guess its not a very safe neighborhood in the neighborhoods in between slums were formed where immigrants generally stayed i shot the video from the roof the most beautiful place in the hotel,3/5
217, very dirty the tub and sink were full of dirt,1/5
218, very dated hotel but perfect beddingimpeccable cleanlinessclose to sites to visit,2/5
219, partially renovated hotel the rooms are small and nonfunctional the kitchen is sparse and unimaginative,2/5
220, this does not have a  star rating this hotel is ok for spending a night not a stay i stayed there  nights my room is the smallest on the floor with a double bed ,2/5
221, room a little old but very clean reception staff very helpful and friendly location a little far from the centre if you travel on foot it is easy to pass through unsavory streets on the other hand there is a metro stop nearby terrace on the th floor with a view of the acropolis spectacular in the evening and for happu hour from pm to pm  cocktails for the price of  very good and abundant buffet breakfast the roast potatoes are delicious for those who love a savory breakfast,4/5
222, central the neighborhood where it is located leaves a lot to be desiredit took them a while to give us the rooms at  pm they were not ready a lot of mess with the suitcases,4/5
223, hotel with rooms that are a little old but very clean it is far from the center but there is a subway nearby being on the outskirts of athens some slightly strange characters roam aroundbe careful the breakfast buffet was excellent on the th floor it has a terrace with a swimming pool which offers spectacular views of athens and the acropolis especially in the evening i recommend the aperitif on the terrace from pm get two get one,4/5
224, it is in a central location it was a hotel where we could rest the breakfast was satisfactory although not very rich we were satisfied,4/5
225, a super varied breakfast a worthy roof top with swimming poolour room with parthenon view its not a super luxury hotel but a really honest one the metro is just a few minutes away red line leading to avropoli,5/5
226, we stayed there for  nights plus  nights the rooms are ok but nothing more a major restoration is to be expected very worn parquet floor blackout curtain does not go all the way to the floor noisy but effective ,4/5
227, i think the reason the rating is low is because this hotel has a swimming pool and is classified as  stars hotel facilities are old and in dire need of renovation however the rooms were clean and provided enough basic necessities including breakfast the location is near the train station so it is convenient to go to huna airport before the meteora tour its a star hotel so its not a good idea to pay a city tax of  euros per night,4/5
228, it doesnt even reach  old furniture bed covers to remove you cant go out at night there are druggies hanging around it doesnt even look like what they publish the waiters are very correct but the reception is insulting they dont even pay attention to you,1/5
229, stay during a combined stay with the islandsold poorly insulated roomsrooftop bar with more than deplorable service that doesnt make up for the view of the acropoliswe didnt understand if it was a  star or a  starto be avoided in all cases,2/5
230, we stayed there for  nights plus  nights the rooms are ok but nothing more a major restoration is to be expected very worn parquet floor blackout curtain does not go all the way to the floor noisy but effective air conditioning too bad the indicator light the temperature remains on we can say that the room is well lit however the bedding is perfect the breakfast buffet offers a large choice as well as the evening buffet a good compromise hotel also on the th floor very beautiful panorama of athens and more a swimming pool,4/5
231, modern room with kettle hairdryer and ironrooftop with very large equipped terrace and swimming pool,5/5
232, really to avoid this hotel should be one starthere is nothing wrong with this hotel the walls are made of cardboard you hear absolutely everything so we might as well tell you that you will not sleep more than  hours per nightthe cleaning ladies one might wonder if they dont wake you up on purpose with trolleys knocking in the doors at  in the morningwe have  dead pigeons on arrival on the balcony as well as obviously droppings on the balconythe swimming pool is not a swimming pool but rather a pool which certainly cannot accommodate more than  people at the same timefor the price of the night its clearly worth avoiding the area is not good the holidays are wasted ,1/5
233, a horrible experience according to atenas one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the city we found everything walking towards the center people taking drugs in the streets of the neighborhood a disastrous location in short everything was fatal,1/5
234, a real shame of a hotel they must have won the stars at a fairit is basically a student hotel and has not been renovated ,1/5
235, the roof terrace is really nice and the pool was still in use even in october the room superior room with city view was big enough the breakfast was perfectly finethe room was really noisy unfortunately you could hear a lot from the neighboring rooms the street noise however wasnt a problem at all with the windows closed the balcony on the other hand was tiny and not useful,4/5
236, slightly out of the center but close to the metro or otherwise a minute walk showering in the bath and sitting on the toilet was difficult because the sink was in the way great roof top nice swimming pool dont expect a large swimming pool with a view of the acropolis draft beer ,4/5
237, the rooms would have been good if the insulation was correct but you can hear the neighbors talking you can understand what they are saying when they speak loudlythe hotel is located next to the train station so it is next to a very noisy road you can hear every car passing by and the motorbikes make a lot more noisewe manage to fall asleep quite easily surprisingly we are woken up by people making noise in the corridor or by hostesses slamming doorswe are lucky to be on the top floor at the end of the corridor only one room adjoins ours on the opposite side of the street i cant imagine the experience in a room close to the elevator andor on a lower floorthe wifi is constantly cutting and is not usablethe staff is okthere is a very pretty roof top with a beautiful swimming pool where you can have cocktails on the other hand it was very windy which meant that we didnt see anyone swimmingbreakfast is ok,2/5
238, very bad experience it is not a  star hotel i would say more than  or  or even hostel we arrived and left within  hours dirty room bad area and very old rooms,1/5
239, we stayed at candia and what a joy the quality of the bedding breakfast and lunch no longer needs to be proven from the welcome to all the staff a pleasure in its own right ,5/5
240, its great location which helped us take  thousand steps and despite its very old rooms it had a wonderful terrace and a view of the acropolis from the terrace breakfast and cookies were great,3/5
241, we stayed the night before catching a flight and it worked for that if you go by rental car there is space to park around on the street ,3/5
242, the hotel made a very nice impression from the outside and inside theres even a small rooftop pool with a hot tub with views of athens and the acropolis my room had an unpleasant view of the backyard and the rooms themselves were very noisy my tv had german programs but they didnt work and the bed was rock hard the room itself was ok breakfast standard nothing special dinner hot dishes were cold buffet dinner not worth mentioning and also cold tip better go eat somewhere elseupdate since i was taking part in a tour i stayed at this hotel again last night the room was more of a broom closet as a solo traveler you get a double room the room was too small for such a big bed i could only open my suitcase on the floor in front of the refrigerator but that meant i couldnt get to the table or the refrigerator at  cm my head was almost on the ceiling when i showered if i sat on the toilet i could lie down on the sink miserable view of the backyard windows broken and rooms so noisy that you thought people were standing in your room to chat my fellow travelers had also told me this about their rooms it there are much nicer  star hotels this one doesnt deserve  stars,2/5
243, the hotel is good the pool is very nice and it has very good views the bathrooms could be improved a little since they are a bit old but well from what i have seen in greece everything is very similar the location is a bit dark in the neighborhood at night but with the metro you can go everywhere quickly breakfast is not bad,3/5
244, dirt and large stains on the bathroom ceiling damaged wardrobe sanitary facilities not in impeccable condition  out of  lamps worked in the room there are practically no sockets for electronic devices in a bedroom of  and when we found one you have to look for them most of them did not work beds were not comfortable hotel in a really uninteresting and dilapidated area of athens in short i do not recommend the this whole hotel it deserves  star but i still give  stars for the kindness and professionalism of the staff  the evening buffet which was not bad,2/5
245, so there are many things to say about this hotel first of all it is located in a not very welcoming area and with no restaurants nearby there is only the metro not very far away it is very poorly soundproofed on all sides you can hear your roommates as well as the street the building itself is pretty but the interior is much less so the elevators are small and dirty the stairs are not straight and the restaurant is  per person for meals worse than a school canteen  the walls are dirty and ready to break the bathroom is poorly furnished and very questionable the only star is for the very friendly staff,1/5
246, hotel anything but  just the rooms are small you have to push everything to open a suitcase no electrical outlets to plug in a telephone you have to unplug the tv or the only lampthe bathroom dates from the s and the system for having electricity in the room dates from the middle agesin addition the neighborhood is uninteresting and borderline creepy fortunately the metro is a  minute walk awayvery positive point the staff is super nice and helpful departure at  am and we were able to have breakfast,1/5
247, the hotel supposedly has  it shouldnt even have  the breakfast is below average the rooms are small the bathrooms are tiny and nonfunctional the shower tub with a plastic curtain is  cm the closet smells of mold breakfast time ended at  on the first of january after new years eve,1/5
248, everything about the hotel is great on par with the level of stars that the hotel has the only complaints are that the staff does not allow you to sit on the terrace located on the roof of the hotel in the evening and that the breakfast is not at an enviable level,4/5
249, great hotel had a room for  people it was sufficient the refrigerator didnt work and there was a solution for it the next day thanks breakfast starts at  am and is constantly replenished great location for exploring the city with the metro but the area there isnt the best we saw homeless people junkies even people taking needles along the way its great for just sleeping there and being out and about during the day there is also a bakery nearby gregorys to stock up for the day black sign with green writing in greek,5/5
250, this hotel was booked through a package tour and so far first impression it is a bit of a faded glory dated bathroom few sockets  beds in the room but working air conditioning mini fridge and balcony the breakfast was one of the best during our tour not worthy of  the rooftop bar offers a fantastic view,3/5
251, we stayed in this hotel for  days during a compact tour of greece in fact the structure is a little dated and the furnishings are not exactly new fan in the bathroom out of order noisy air conditioning but at least in use acceptable level of cleanliness at least in our room however i must say that the staff like everyone in greece are really courteous and helpful with guests and this is an added value always rich and varied buffet breakfast overall acceptable for a short stay,3/5
252, good hotel for those who dont have many demands it is  minutes from the center of athens we traveled around in taxis which are very cheap but it is also connected by metro ,4/5
253, very decent hotel clean good breakfast very kind and welcoming staffthe room was simple but very pleasantthe terrace with swimming pool is clean and offers a nice view of athens ,5/5
254, i dont really knowroom is the bare minimum everything works and so on but nothing more the view of the street leaves a lot to be desired a friends streetlight shone into his room its just moderately good food too i hardly ate any warm food there the only really good thing is the view on the terrace but i cant say anything more positive about this hotel not  stars and certainly not ,2/5
255, very average hotel for a just enough to spend  night before going to the islandsaverage cleanliness and unhelpful staffpoorly located near a railway line ,2/5
256, bad experience located in a conflictive area drug addict area of eroina and crash the only good thing was the pool on the terrace,1/5
257, room not very clean and very noisy service does not speak a word of french very difficult to be understood location very well located  minutes walk from the metro,3/5
258, relatively close to the subway station to get to the city centervarious timelimited tickets inexpensive pull from the machine and go the hotel offers a great breakfast service otherwise standard,5/5
259, a little dated hotel quite close to the subway staff were initially a little difficult but then turned out to be very friendly and helpful they have a great ace up their sleeve an amazing terrace with swimming pool and view of the parthenon,4/5
260, charming hotel somewhat dated although the ground floor looks neat the bedroom is different curved laminate and a not very clean bathroom which should have been replaced a long time ago in the room itself there was only a ceiling lamp there was no night or mood lamp what struck me was that the photos on the site were very different from reality you would have to imagine a number of decades of deteriorationthe breakfast was generous and there was a lot to choose from,2/5
261, we stayed at this hotel recently the strong point is that it is close to the larises metro station which allows you to easily reach every destination the other positive aspect is the continental breakfast ,2/5
262, unpleasantly surprised for a  an advertised swimming pool turning out to be a small pool no sound insulation in the rooms mediocre breakfast and indifferent reception staff and absolutely not like the  stars advertised only the view from the top floor is worth seeing,1/5
263, we kicked off our tour through greece in athens with a stay at hotel candia we were welcomed very warmly by the staff so much fun ,3/5
264, to begin with the photos are taken at a good angle making things very beautiful which is not the case for example the swimming pool is very very small you cant fit  people in it the rooms are very small for a person room the same size as a twoperson room the air conditioning sounds like a truck and the road next to it doesnt help mattersthe staff is very very unpleasant they pull dirty faces as soon as a service is requested its borderline if you dont get yelled at for being rudeas for the meal it remains ok but it is very often the same thing and some dishes are industrialas for the location it is very bad an area that is very scary after a certain timefinally for the price it does not correspond at all to what he offered us i strongly advise against this hotel run away ,1/5
265, very good pricequality ratio it is not luxury but to spend two nights it is greatquite complete and rich buffetthe terrace and pool are great and very pleasant for the afternoonsnormal room you can hear when people pass by and when they close and open the doors to your hallway,4/5
266, i stayed at this hotel in september in principle the hotel is good i was quite satisfied with a small room with a window onto the courtyard with a kettle cups and a set for tea and coffee ,3/5
267, same food every day disgusting food ive never eaten it before and they warm up yesterdays food and give it to us i booked food for free we always sat outside never again in this hotel,1/5
268, good cheap hotel a bit old good breakfast great rooftop terrace with pool and bar quite far from everything located on two main roads and train tracks it is extremely loud,4/5
269, unfortunately not a good priceperformance ratio not a  star hotel more of a not so good  star there are better alternatives,3/5
270, very welcoming accommodation well maintained and organised helpful staff clean rooms and decent quality of food served in the breakfast room and restaurant recommended for those who want to be in the heart of the hellenic capital in just a few minutes either on foot or by metro the nearest metro stop is about m away wifi is quite slow and the swimming pool on the top floor is too small and shallow these are the only negative points besrwestern hotel athens greece comfort holiday sea marathon metro,4/5
271, what a terrible noise hotel we have a lot of hotel experience but despite the friendly staff there is little positive to write about it a lot of noise pollution from mostly youth groups until late at night ,2/5
272, the hotel is conveniently located close to many attractions if you have good mobility you can easily go everywhere on foot ,3/5
273, a bit old but nevertheless clean good windows no street noise a few minutes to the metro  stops to syntagma square breakfast plentiful the usual nice staffthe small pool on the roof terrace is great for cooling off in the afternoonevening,4/5
274, i liked the hotel it has everything that tourists need comfortable bed modern tv russian channels linen change and room cleaning every day there is a kettle and tea coffee in the room ,4/5
275, hotel with excellent service and tasty breakfast the poorer review is due to the rooms themselves they are clean but small you also dont walk  to the highlights of athens a company like tui can also do this better by either choosing differently or upgrading this hotel,4/5
276, we expected more the lobby and the room looked very dark in the room  light bulbs were broken the table lamp didnt turn on and  sockets didnt work ,3/5
277, despite the fact that the hotel is not new and is located near the railway tracks we were very pleased with the location not far from the center and main attractions parking nearby  euros per day and the attitude ,4/5
278, complies with everything they offer in my hotel voucher i only had accommodation and the hotel told me that they gave me breakfast because it was included for all their guests the staff very attentive and friendly they have a terrace with a small pool upstairs at night you have a drink at the bar and have views of the acropolis of athens the rooms have comfortable beds and more than enough sink very happy with this hotel,4/5
279, on january  my husband and i came to get acquainted with the capital of greece athens through the mouzenidis travel company ,4/5
280, the only advantage is the welcome setcourtesy for the rest we certainly wont return ,1/5
281, this is a hotel for a few nights when we saw the hotel we thought what is this but it wasnt too bad ,3/5
282, very good and clean hotels with amazing breakfast reminiscent of lunch incredible varietythe only negative is that on the top floor you can hear noise in the rooms from the pool on the roof and at night you can hear the cleaning machine if you stay i suggest you dont choose the th and th floor,4/5
283, the worst thing was definitely the rockhard bed which gave me a backache the room was a bit small but reasonable for the price there was a large selection at breakfast but the juices are not recommended and the other things were more okay than tasty the lobby and the roof area with pool are very nice and modern the staff is nice the hotel is located near a subway stationoverall it offers pretty good service for the price,3/5
284, supposedly star hotel with cockroaches and bed mattress that crawl into you,1/5
285, nice rooms with nice buffet a little issue with the fuss but in athens you cant ask for too muchthe room is ideal for a family with a child,4/5
286, as soon as you arrive you think that the hotel is abandoned because on the outside it is completely neglected when you enter things dont get better old outdated hotel with a musty smell the rooms are horrible and the bathroom is scary and disgusting plus it has ants the pool is rather small it is not a  star hotel at most  bad experience,1/5
287, i was put in the worst room out of several i think everything else is pretty average when you open the room there is a bed and there is no place to store your suitcase ,1/5
288, we booked this hotel as a family and it was the only one in athens that offered a family room at an affordable price ,3/5
289, located in the metaxourgheio district this hotel is a stones throw from larissa station and the metro station ,5/5
